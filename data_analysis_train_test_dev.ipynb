W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined.

       "\"I just want to give you Mike again, the first presentation I received an email and I searched on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy Italy and in another country in Europe, but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. this aspect is the most important one. It is twice important as the following. The second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative. that stands for new technical features. And then that This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of L_C_D_ or speech recognition. But we already have the flashing flashing light the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. We already discussed that. d our our target group we thought about was young and trendy. So I took that part of the webpage. And it says fashion-watchers of Pari France and Italy, yeah, have detected the following trends. This trends I th trend I think it's not that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about clothes and shoes. But the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. Spongy, like sponge. So rubber, kind of. soft materials. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. But I didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball. because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control, I think about changeable fronts. maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. And some basic colour fronts. maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. just another shape than a normal remote control ha has. We have to discuss about that. Main point still\""

       "\"my name's adam duguid, ebenezer ademesoye. i'm the marketing expert. tarik rahman. t_a_r_i_k_. industrial designer., dave cochrane. and you're going to be the user interface,this is the agenda for today's meeting. as you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, the very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. we're gonna have the three kay phases, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? here we have an elephant. tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry?, here we have a tiger. dave, if you'd like to have a dash., the monkey,. but cats are one of my favourite animals,project finance. as you can see, twelve point five euros per unit. and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. that was profiting,do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? like control pads, you know of games, and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well.any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? one thing i'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes that can be programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, b it occurs to me there might be a niche for for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. and therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket. with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive, but you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros. would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the t_v_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the right channel as well, i've noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, i've seen the bar-code design before, instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, keypad, for playing games. i think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot., you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, that'll bebut you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the t_v_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the right channel as well,so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality,, how the user interface might work,project finance. as you can see, twelve point five euros per unit.and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five.mm-hmm. the other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form,one thing i'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive,we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,the other option of course is that the the clapping one. digital telephones, for example, one unit has somewhere where there's a button, of course you have to have that base unit, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t_v_. something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. again say what, it would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario i would say, so that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the t_v_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an l_e_d_, we could just incorporate it anyway.do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_. should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? we could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? actually i would say maybe two two function buttons, the y we're now using the menus button and and an og and an okay button. i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? yeah, think so. so that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the t_v_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an l_e_d_, we could just incorporate it anyway. you could go for quite an interesting design. something that can make it stand out slightly. i should just look at the speaker, the speaker and an l_e_d_.we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there.i mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid, would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? i would say so, yes, i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now.remote control should only be used for the t_v_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues.i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_.teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet.i'm responsible for working design,, this is basically the inside going on of the the remote control. so we have the energy source, we have the user interface, the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, do we need many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that,, there'd be more components to deal with that. you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, you have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, will contact the t_v_ do we need on the control different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs,, i dunno what we should decide on that.i i was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? we could use say the left and right for changing channels and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay.this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote. the presentation is already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i've looked at looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. on the one hand and this this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. and on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. but the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what what a given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most. something that's something that is more programmable, that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha orbut if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen i think probably for the first couple of hours of using itbut i think we don't have a specific audience, like what is our target audience, i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile., if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose. maybe then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers, rather than the public. however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, it's just, the way i figure it, twelve point five euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that,, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television.i hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice activated control. however i've got a couple of worries about that. the power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l_c_d_ which has been kind of put forward so far, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels i i was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white. si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined. we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sortwe'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the t_v_ a bit more, mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, and ergonomics of the remote control as well. it's come to my attention the following. teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. remote control should only be used for the t_v_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues. also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. just to say quickly i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so. i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first,finally, my opinion. the voice recognition thing is cool. and voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. it's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. i'm pretty sure people would buy it. i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, so if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that however, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. but if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. there're two options. either you have voice recognition by itself, which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control,, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a whilefunctional requirement by me ebenezer. we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. we asked some open ended questions, and we asked some very specific questions, please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. takes too long to master the remote control. i've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, some of the good stuff we got. between the age of fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different,however, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, so if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that i'm pretty sure people would buy it. for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. and voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. the voice recognition thing is cool. but for a very fixed number of words, it's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, i mean most people use a remote control

control. however i've got a couple of worries about that. the power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voicedo we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? yeah, think so.and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay?we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,say something like lithium ion battery,product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. you're gonna look at product evaluation.you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay.seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, having the use of the l_c_d_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components,, say something like lithium ion battery, looks like we going for a double curved design. i don't know what cost implications there are in that., looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. there would be basically two points of articulation. w one below and one above the m the the main sort of grip. do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? but it could be a weak point in the structure, do you think? if you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? sure, yeah. make it harder to lose, as well. the noise for when you lose the banana, f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. y you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the t_v_ responds to. but if weprogramming them can be a right pain. so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer and you could download programs for it from for t_v_s from all sort of main manufacturers. i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the t_v_ responds to. but if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_ programming it to use your t_v_, you might hook it up to the p_c_. the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming i'm not sure, but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u_s_b_ might be prohibitive.like i said before i i think we should have the r_r_ on the on the top function button. so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used.., looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber.looks like we going for a double curved design.if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? sure, yeah.we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. and then we we research fashion trends in europe, we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. as in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, technology technical technologically innovative. people want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. like the interface is really important. and easy to use, it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. the fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. how that relates to a remote control i don't know. spongy. if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then can i skip the rest? the rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. kinda spongy material. we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future now the fruit and veg options, either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. few questions about a spongy remote control. i've never seen one before. if we want something strong and sturdy, i say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, i just don't know how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonnai was given a an h_t_m_l_ file giving various ideas from from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. i wasn't very impressed by them nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. rather than looking at other remotes, ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. and what we've basically decided on was the the the joy the joystick, two function buttons and the l_c_d_, i don't actually think we need the the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available v via via the l_c_d_ is one where you scroll through channels, you must have two two modes, basic mode, where the joystick's left right left right for channels, up down for volume, and the and the menu mode for further functions. now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. and also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the the you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, you know, soft to touch the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the f of the four finger and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users. and you then have, at the at the bottom, the l_c_d_, and this would need to be articulated as well. the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. and then thethis meeting is the conceptual design phase and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of,, the case le that's what i wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic. but later on we found out that it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. we decide what it's gonna be. probably plastic. we need the infra-red transmitter. joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it, could be plastic w or rubber even as well. three different types of batteries. can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else a solar powered one. the bat the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? and solar cells, i dunno about that.. we should probably just use conventional batteries., just like in usual remote controls.. and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? double curved. it probably means this is probably double curved. whereas a single curved would be like that. it looks better than the single curve, but you can't have it in titanium, and for the buttons, it can have the scroll wheel but it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use l_c_d_ it's even more expensive. there's trade-offs there. you have to decide, if you have a double curve control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. i reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l_c_d_, does that in shoot the costi think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say the requirements that we've set out. those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick, l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck.quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation.. we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them? people made good use of the pen and paper? i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this. though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves. how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? good. yeah i liked it, leadership. as much as can be leadered in this thing. very good. last one we've got is room for creativity. unti until until accounts came along, we're burs bursting with creativity. we we're not lacking in ideas, i think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. i think we needed a larger budget.. i mean i th i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in i i think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and such. maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more yeah, to begin with. it is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, before i quickly write up a final report. but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff.we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. so five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. which gives us an average of three. it's it's not bad. considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good?we've got the use of the l_c_d_. i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ displayas for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, because it's gonna be flat on one side, i've said single curved. so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l_c_d_ display. other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first, and show us the prototype. quite how the best way to do this is, i'm not sure, i think if we both step up and outline our ideas. do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the l_e_d_. as it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round, but as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand, the l_ the l_c_d_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design. this design could be done with with plastic casing. though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. i i got your note about keeping the cost down. as for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, really the curve that's most needed is the underside and you have thethis design could be done with with plastic casing. is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, plastic for some reason incurs no cost,l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow,slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, or what we did was that we we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we've got point two of a euro left over there. even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate. it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now.. we've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the l_c_d_. i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the l_c_d_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. mm-hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular do you have any data on how much different prints cost? i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design? you now have as much information as i do.. i've said single curved. we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, if i've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button. as you can see, the use of an l_c_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well i'm very much open to suggestions of wherebasic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. it's a seven s seven seven step kinda evaluation process. seven scale. after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those i put together from the user requirements phase. those are the criteria. and perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points. we have to go through each point. and just give it a a score. how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. i mean, is the homing thing still the locator, is that still yeah, that's still part of the design. i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost,. and making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing, on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? i'd say number one. just before we go through all of the steps here, well what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. something i neglected from my initial research that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. and this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? i guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, and we can come back to it, you said. slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budgetability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. three. i think we can do three. reduce the number of unused buttons. i'd say we're doing well there. easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus we're not doing so badly. easy to use let's forget that one. fancy looking. it doesn't get much fancier. technologically innovative. we're getting rid of the locator thing. i'd give it a three for this for that. i mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on on a remote, materials that people find pleasing. sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. plastic, it sucks. mm-hmm. i'd s i i'd give it a six, to be honest. that's totally thrown everything off balance. inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours. we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype leopard print would be cool. but by this i think it's more a case of fruit and veg, it would also help keep the the product placement is this like a banana type colour? it's not shaped like a banana is i i think s i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie.. i mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg,. i'd i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. yeah, i'll go with five.we'll come back to your evaluation just to give you an idea, you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well,most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, we've got the use of the l_c_d_.. i think if we remove the the l_c_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings if we remove the l_c_ display, we could save ourselves i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ displaywas that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs or what we did was that we we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we've got point two of a euro left over there. even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate. it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now.. i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, if i've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, this one comes in under price as you can see, what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? have we factored that in? no, we haven't, not that's too expensive if we remove the l_c_ display, we could save ourselves i mean ho how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the the articulation? i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved,changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved, could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.the industrial designer, is going to be looking more into the working design.and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to yourthe industrial designer, is going to be looking more into the working design. user interface designer. i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w so technical function. what is technical functions exactl what effect should the thing ha should it have, and the m_e_, what does that stand for? m marketing, right.. so we'll be working on the user requirements,, i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t_v_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. what if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? hand-sized.i also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons, but like, i don't know you, just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like, no, you never use half of them. so. but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. so you can programme like your favourite channels, but, would you have the screen on the thing, or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen. so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, i mean, we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device.our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro., and we will hope to sell this internationally. how many should we sell then? well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty, that'll do four million.user interface designer. i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w so technical function.experience with remote control., i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t_v_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. what if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? hand-sized. i also think

other thing you said that thing about robust and water water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to yourso we'll be working on the user requirements, marketing, right..so f here's our agenda for today. we're gonna do some tool training, project plan and discuss then close. so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. right. functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things.so we're gonna try out our white board. so you want us to draw it and then talk about it? or just draw it? i think both. we ought to decide who starts and all that., i'm abigail claflin. and i guess we should all get acquainted. so this is our kick off meeting. hi i'm chiara, i'm the marketing expert. i'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer. i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer.and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in., teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list., also our remote should be used only for television,, and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this,so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? it's easy to implement. but i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme, if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. and i was thinking, i_r_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work, so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. yeah, so it would be a two part package. do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall we probably leave that. so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range, you don't need a light. and like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so then it can live anywhere. like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's'cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities. and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type, that's the the technology these days., how do i put this so what happens it doesn't work? could you just plug it back into hers the cable might be a little loose or something. okay so now i need to press f_ eight, what is it? what's function?i think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know, like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the t_v_. so we definitely want a power button and numbers. that sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah. but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then? you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like w right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down. like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just so but i'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you're if you're on t_v_, like you can switch channels, but then if if you're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracksin order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, i don't know what r_s_i_ means. so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. the other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. and if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and, most likely,and i think we should design according to these buttons.this my presentation about the technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. and okay so basically i think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way, keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum, but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the t_v_. or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_? i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour and you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote, so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_. and also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t_v_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, processor to take the information, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be, battery for the energy source, a button pad for input, i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_, and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself.so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall we probably leave that.like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's then it can live anywhere.you don't need a light. and like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, soyou know actually our our new project requirements, i'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things. so i'll i'll check that and update you on the nextso everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire,then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.it's easy to implement. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. yeah, so it would be a two part package.if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.so we definitely want a power button and numbers.like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just that sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.but the only thing is like, ipods are so expensive, i don't think it's the wheel dealy. so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire, then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kindaand you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation.you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits., i'll just review what we did in our last meeting., under marketing we targeted our audience,, then we considered some design options with how it should look,, can i do next? 'cause i have to say something about the material and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion, fancy look and feel.. next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. and th last thing is the easy to use factor., our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend so we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. and also go for a spongy feel, i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go.. i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?, our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend so we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. and also go for a spongy feel, i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go.. i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?i think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo, oh, a dynamo is, it's a bicycle. it's a bicycle mechanism. yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. so i sort of picked battery. no. but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own. so if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f i find them annoying. but we need to find cost. like the chip is probably the most expensive part.so i've been looking at the components design., so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard., i assume we'll be custom designing our case, and we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board,, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, the ipod-style wheel. and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote., i'd recommend against titanium, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case., well we can use wood. i don't know why we'd want to., and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design., we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip.oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough.i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out,i mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes, i mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. like, i think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir i'm f i'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. w when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top i think, if you held it like that. what if,, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingif you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingand then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, so i guess we have to look into the,, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's oh how they make the menu show up on the t_v_? i believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t_v_, not inside the remote.oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there.we're gonna try to talk about, what kind of how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. and,, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system., so people are going to be looking at this little screen. i mean i assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. but the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on. i mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ yeah, well we don't want the screen i guess,but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingi mean i assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. but the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if and then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. yeah, well we don't want the screen i guess,you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing so where are the fruit and vegetables now? i guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.but we need to find cost. does anyone have costs on the on the web? all it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. it didn't give me any actual cost.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,okay we have to fill in all this stuff. so i guess we're supposed to write final reports.so i guess we're supposed to write final reports. all of us? i don't know... or is that just me?and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft, powerpoint or any of this stuff. but l but i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, i don't really think i dunno what i'm doing here. and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations, my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff yeah well mine was mostly made up but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a wholethe prototype making was very creatively stimulating it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. yeah, i thought we all worked very well together.i guess we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of i felt like i was off-task all the time. what do you guys think of the pens? they're kinda hard to write with though.but l but i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, i don't really think i dunno what i'm doing here. and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations, my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff yeah well mine was mostly made up but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a wholeso our design looks something like this. this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever. and the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. so you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. you could change the vegetable, or fruit. it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out. it's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable,last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft, powerpoint or any of this stuff.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,and i think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. 'cause i mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. we could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. and you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. we could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. and you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. well the worst ones were three point one. material technologically innovative, batteries easy to insert for some reason, i think that's not a problem any more. you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, it might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.and the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. we can do it separately and then discuss it we'll just go in a circle. okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? so it's a one was true and seven was false? oh i thought it was the other way round. i thought it was the other way round too.right what happens is we have to decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start. and we we have therefore in total we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. true is one and and false is seven. i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. apparently i'm supposed to use the whiteboard. is it necessary? i don't think so. we'll just go in a circle. okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? i'm i'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone.if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an excel spreadsheet. the only one that's in there, production costs. but if i missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed i said uncurved or flat. my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. there's plastic for that area around the button. and lots of special colours actually. okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.well the locator is just chip that's inside there. and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, and we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the the project initiation. first of all i want to ask mister ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and well i think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. we'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. but do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or for the moment not yet. do you have some project plan, something with you or this is like i said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. so by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan, okay, certainly by the next meeting. so there's any questions or first of all about this project?good morning everybody here. and i want to introduce myself, my name is shrida daseri and i'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. so i want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here. my name is agnes and i'm an user usability user interface designer. my name is ed and i do accounting. do you also do marketing? so only accounting? and i'm christine, and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer. so who is marketing, nobody in the market marketing is, is me.yes, so what i prefer maybe you need to interact more with the christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, so, what i prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the christine more and within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do the your sales plan, okay, do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up that's up to us to decide,? yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is you both of the christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. then we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. okay, so i think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. okay, and if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. or maybe, you are my coordinator, am i right? i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look atwould you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? yes, i will. yes.well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. it should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition, th i agree it has to be something it has to be something new, whether it works or not, they have to first say i like this, i like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use.and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that.christine, what about your the industrial design plan? are you have a design already on this product or you're still working on the design? no, i i have not begun working on the design, i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and i understood that that was the project goal. i just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, so you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? well, i would th think that depends on how much money you give us. because, you know, you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models. yeah, but before we talk about the finance, okay, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also. i kind of think that in general you have to do y you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal, and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own. so it would really would need to you know, i don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. but when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? well, i've got a lot of other projects i'm doing right now if they go quickly then it could be a month. if if i run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. so like what's your functional design, what's your technical design, and how many people you need for this project, and what's the time frame you're looking, okay, and what is the budget, maybewhat is the goal of the project? the goal of the project i think maybe i'll hand out to the ed, okay, so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. so can you explain what exactly the product is? from what i had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, oh i think, if i'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. 'cause i had two different things. i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. so we're have to design something that is very user friendly. something visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product, because i think everybody's experienced with remote controls, we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use, 'cause a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed, okay, and how it's going to be work,well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, no, i i have not begun working on the design, i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and i understood that that was the project goal. i just did s see that we were starting a new project togetherso, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, orokay, so i think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay.so, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about further things. would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? yes, i will. yes. and if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me, or just send me email, or just come and knock my door, okay,so then we can discuss about further things.from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to to give an idea what the management is looking for, i was looking for a a remote control to have a s i have a sales price of twenty-five euro, with a production price of twelve and a half euro. for what i think from what we're trying to find, we're tr we're looking for, i don't think that price is exactly in the market. in the recent surveys, from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. twenty-five euros, that's that's a preson reasonable price. now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, then it w it could possibly sell. but, i think there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. and we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. louder, softer, on, off. thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. so we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly. fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. so maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep, but, in the cost that the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. but if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's very easy easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like i said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, so we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial design. but, price obviously we have to talk about. what do you think about the design, what he was talkingwhat i can suggest to you, christine, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, i can recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_, because they're already in this speech recognition part, and if you want, i can coordinate, okay, to get some information, and you can let me know, okay, so what kind of the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from what today.from from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. what do they want?, a risk, take a risk on the market? something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily s make a boom in the market? because it has to be something totally different, but end of the day, you're the sales guy, it's of course it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us i don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of the management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, they want something new, i think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, and i hope i can convince the management on that,the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. so, in our case, existing remote controls. we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, and then what the remote control should look like, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off. you need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever. the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. the buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. so, i would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons. so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placedshould we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? i mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? i mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting,and it will be slim, 'cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like i said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. so maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep,it says individual actions, and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. supposed to work on the user interface concept, so i'm supposed to do the components concept, and eliminate them later in the process,from from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. what do they want? the management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, i think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, and i hope i can convince the management on that,and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.supposed to work on the user interface concept,and eliminate them later in the process, i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.and if you want, i can coordinate, okay, to get some information, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, i can recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_,so i'm supposed to do the components concept,management come with the new proposal, and i have to discuss a few points on this. both says new insights in the aim of your project. the one is the teletext becomes outmoded, okay because if because of the computer systems and the new technology. we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. and the second one is about the remote control. should be used only for the t_v_. and the third point, it's very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product.i'll invite christine to discuss about the functional design. i i figured we should identify some user requirements, and from my experience, i wanna, and from research i did, the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those, and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction, especially in the the the outside of the product i did a little history on the the remote controls all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which i think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind. you could throw it at things if if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. but i just took some different schematics and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. personal preferences, i i'm really thinking outside the box here, and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. so something that's very very flexible and inflatable i think it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and kind of blend in with things, i think it needs to be waterproof, because sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, i keep pushing on the remote control, and i don't know if it's actually understood my message, so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. and, course i never wanna replace the batteryif you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. because especially today, you know, you have the family and the kids, and the kids throw it if you can add the feature, okay, for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, i dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. titanium would be be heavy, too, i wanted feedback, but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts. i like titanium. expensive. it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though.do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it. then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. an and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay.maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. an and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay. so, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay, then, then we can proceed from there.maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. so, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay,you know, maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like a b some sort of a foam rubber ball, and then they would squeeze it, and it would take the shape of their hand. but th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. it was nokia that came out with this changeable colours. right, you take it apart, and put on another face, take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions, millions. we'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna learn about labour laws. you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap, but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries. so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, india we're here to design, come up with a nice product. but that that we can that we can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the the quantity, okay. so we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something, but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay,and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so i mean i think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be so, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you. i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it. what we'll do is,, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until th ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display.why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood.i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? do you wanna take an action item to go find out?so, it's a very short presentation, 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board i took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume and channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded, so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control. so, that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability., one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. and also you had issues with the batteries running out, so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. and in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses and, like you said, speech recognition. you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself, so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels and volume, sort of for surfing channels and then volume, so the volume would be the up and down, 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels lefti mean i think it's a good idea, so, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it.i also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. i also have copied a different type of remote. we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today, 'cause trends change very very quickly. looking for next generation of innovation, fancy and feel-good, that's what we've been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that's easy to use. easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that, and i think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. the second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. the second one, there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use. the first one, i see that they put in a display. now there's something else with the little flip-up, now we're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip-up, if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. maybe the display also makes it easier to use, so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours context-sensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ or something else is in. especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition andwe'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, india but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries.we were looking he specifically at the components the following components, the case, the power supply, the means of communications with the television set. in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition, you have to have microphone well no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device, it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record, what's worked, what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because, course, we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us, so for the case, we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. course, you know, i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it's goes with the board. and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, so we still had titanium and and wood available, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium, so then there's this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board, these simple chips, but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one. and then there was the regular which i regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one. the other option wasbut le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay, a customisable and and i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. so the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determinednevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood. i i'd really think we should, you know, use some of some really exotic woods, like, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. i think that people will might really want to design their own cases, and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have have it be made out of wood. why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? because it gets brittle, cracks we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. i think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, i mean it chips, it if you drop it, so so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. i think if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that,i think that people will might really want to design their own cases, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. so the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determined and i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. a customisable and i think they could be rubber like they are now, what about the buttons, would would the buttons be wood too, ori would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. you can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. in fact, we should sell through amazon, or ebay, yeah. that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, and you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. the weight and feel. but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit. i don't think that's not possible,well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. let's proceed with this model, okay, for the for the marketing direction, okay. so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. so we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the second generation. the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. no, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped, when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. so, you're right, timing is very important,ed, d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t_v_ remote control sales? would it be the christmas season by any chance? the sports time. sports season. right before the eur the world cup. world soccer. world cup soccer, yeah, that's a good idea. but, so, i'm just ig pointing out a a strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at a a major sports event that's actually good place to advertise it too. there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it, maybe some management has got relationships there we can leverage. yes, the that of course i will convince the management to do that, okay.so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.and we've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it's too expensive, well then you just take it off. this is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. so if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display. s and it's one of those very light, very touchable displays. additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front.so then let's come to the finance, i have some calculations which i made as for the budget. so here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells. it's optional, somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print, that's what we were talking about that. so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker, then we have the wood material, then special colour and push button. actually, our budget was twelve point five euro, but it's coming to nine point nine five euro, so we are under below the budget, well we haven't come to mine yet, so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion, yes.. it's gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it? on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a l_c_ display. l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive, no we do, but it's not filled in. we don't have the price up there, you're right, sorry, yes. okay, so if we add approximately two to three euro per remote, now we're up around about twelve, twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested. so that means we can put the the l_c_d_ in, yeah. but as far as production i'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. so when it go into the quantity, okay, and the cost will come down. although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on on-order basis, it might be the the quantity won't m won't it'sso what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions, whatever, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount. if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five euro, with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. at two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit. i just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these. now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. but being that the market changes very very quickly, maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. so, now we have to come up with a decision. can the company sell two million units? can it sell it for fifty euros?yes, the that of course i will convince the management to do that, okay.and let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is overokay, let's talk about maybe first for the prototype. i've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done, so if i'm missing anything, christine can just correct me. from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, the yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. you have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. the green are the channel changing. and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom, and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_, and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. the material that we chose was wood, and the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. we haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. that depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left i think the microphone is on on the top, on the middle, the under the flip. but it shouldn't be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice. my opinion i think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, okay, so then you can speak then you can close it. but if you put it on the on the flip, okay, then technical i don't think it's feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, i can just use my voice. i mean it doesn't have to be onokay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value.it can be on the side somewhere. yeah, the sides maybe is good.so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.in fact, we should sell through amazon, or ebay, yeah. so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. that's actually good place to advertise it too. there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it,so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. so we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time andokay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real. we probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it.this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. it's gonna be very hard to reduce. so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down. at two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit.well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. no, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time andfirst we have three steps of making the the remote control. fir the first thing is th the functional design, we have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, the the second thing is the conceptual design, that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. and we have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market. and the third thing is the detailed design it's exactly how it looks and whatever.these are two smartboards, with the f s an introduction of that one. and you already saw you know all that that you here can put things in the the red project map. what we're going to do first is you have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. and and say why it's your favourite animal. first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. use pen format. and a different colour can use here line width ten. just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. it's a very nice elephant, you can see. it's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying. and then what's the colour? how do i do it's in format. just make a new blank new blank page. maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, let's make it a dog. i make a cat of it. i just draw too quick i think. i thought these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to word, but you actually got to write on the paper. but i d i i thought it would be just in in in typed words in word, but it's just a picture. y you can you can't edit in the edit it in word. it's not that cool as i th thought it would be. now we just have to save everything,hello. hello. you all read what we are going to do or not? we're gonna make a remote control. i just made a a simple presentation. that's my name,. we're going to make a remote control, are we going to this agenda of our meeting. you know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. it has to be original, trendy, user-friendlymy laptop is crashing. actually my laptop doesn't work, okay. i think it works. how does this work? press f_ eleven. just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. it's a bit slow you can see, how do i doyeah, it probably would be universal. i don't think you can buy a a a universal remote control for twenty five euros, i know you can buy a re a universal control for only twenty euros we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ player so a lot of buttons on the remote control.what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, we can try to make it special. if we control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it it has to be clear, and how big should it be? it shouldn't be too big, but i don't think we can make it too small, we can't make it smaller than the things we see now i think. or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. maybe more trendy. fold open, where you can see more options. i think something on top, just dren general things like volume and t_v_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. o or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? or maybe to keep it easy and small. but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. and we have to care for the strength of the remote control, because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken. and if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. you can put games on your remote control. whatever.ma maybe a home station. should you put it in a recharger but yeah, we have to look at the price now i think. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, the option, just the option, that's cool.what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros. and we have to make a profit of fifty million euros, so we have to use a big market in europe. the production cost are about half the price of selling price, can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million,for m for me the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do i need to think as a user, what's in the market, i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_, a d_v_d_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.we're gonna have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? that's a good question. because we sell it lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it apart.yeah, it probably would be universal. we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ playerwe have to close this to finish this meeting, for m for me the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do i need to think as a user, what's in the market, i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_, a d_v_d_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.and how about the batteries? should you put it in a recharger ma maybe a home station. but yeah, we have to look at the price now i think. how much is your standards mobile phone recharger? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive, but i don't know what the project projection costs are for such a thing. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, because lots of people are lose their remote control and don't know where it is, maybe use it as a separate option. sell it separately. and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station, or you can change your batteries, the option, just the option, that's cool.i i set something on paper already, size, looks, usable, the buttons on usable places, the the on off button must be on top, it has to lay good in the hand, does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works. you can have the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume obviously on t on top, so you can see. so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. but the rest is you don't use that often, and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, on on top are the the basic options on top, basically when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or so, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. so maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. just think about it.we can try to make it special. or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. where you can see more options. i think o or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. and if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. so maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. just think about it.so we just can skip the l_c_d_ r on the remote control, i i think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, yeah, i tho i think that's not usable. i don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. okay, no speech recognition.we can make the normal one also a normal light. not a led light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. yeah, i think so. if you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, it's the same as the telephone. yeah.we definitely should use it. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. i use te teletext every day, i think. we just keep it one level then?i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a t_v_ remote control only. it still has to be f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. all these points we have to look at. the the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people. so we have to look at that as well. 'specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, so make it just a different colour or different shape,and the the forty plus people, i already told you. oh, this is a problem. oh sorry about that. the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. so it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's it changes things. that kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. but younger people i think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext.i've used a marketing report on the site. i think you've read it too. and f and furthermore i surfed the o the other site. i didn't get it anyway. i i was the only one who get it. it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users. and they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof. i i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of a lot of findings. seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. so we have to make a beautiful remote control. eighty percent of users would spend when a remote control will l look fancy. older people will spend more money for something what's good. because younger people are more critical about where they spend their money money at. seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. i think we we have to make good zap buttons. the last point is quite an interesting fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. and maybe our fold open system is is a good one, we should have the ten percent on the on the top, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. that's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to recharge the batteries or something. i thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. you must find it quickly.. maybe just a button on the home station. so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station. we can combine that. it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. i think we must t take a look at this. it's only th thirty four of the thirty four percent. but it's a tough one. next, remote controls are bad for r_s_i_. because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we we c this is sothat's not very good, because i thought about television, d_v_d_ player, stereo and v_c_r_. but it's already out of the question, this. my point is, well, i if we ma make a a remote control for only television, i think it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros.we have a new age of forty plus. but y but you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients? so we just can skip the l_c_d_ r on the remote control, i i think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for twenty five euros.technical functions design. but we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. not too full, like jens already said, only ten percent is being used. what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or but yes basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. a way to find out what people use is maybe just to use questionnaires on the internet of functions i could think of. volume, channels, the the basic according to. just one two three etcetera. text service options. basic on-off. play, pause. i dunno if that's usable miss did i miss any other buttons, basic buttons? that's the only th the only thing you need. the p next and previous. li like a web browser, six seven eight or five. but there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before. like a web browser back button. but i think it's all too difficult for old people. just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time. i think f especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. yeah, the ten plus button. just one one pressing, or quickly after each other. w wouldn't it be a problem to because you h have to be fast enough. but i think that's in the t_v_ as well. that's how the the t_v_ t_v_ handles it. so you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons. it's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. so if you have a universal t_v_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu. so you also need a menu button. and then navigation but we can integrate that with volumeit's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. so if you have a universal t_v_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. so we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. so that it can be used with all the t_v_s. we have to really understand what patterns are used, otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to an automatically search function for each television, or something. i dunno how it's exactly how it works. i i use a universal remote control, and you have to put in a number, i have a modern one. and the modern one you you you type search, and after a short time the television turns off. and then you know, oh it it's the right one.l_c_d_ doesn't work for twelve and a half euros i think. and i d i don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control, i i don't y you'll use it often, because you can see on the television wh what channel you i think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. because the like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good i think. but some of you had something to read about speech recognition. yeah, i tho i think that's not usable. that's very that's fancy. that's cool. only the numbers, only numbers. furthermore nothing. but only the numbers, one to twenty or something. yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well. if it's possible. i don't think it's very expensive actually. i didn't have information about that. and and and does it have to work only in english, or in dutch too or that's a problem, only in english. only in english i think. it's probably my job to figure that out, does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever then th we have to think about that. maybe maybe it's too hard to to realise that. we have short time to to put it on the market, in indeed the languages are a difficult thing. i don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. a someone says that give me one coke, and the t_v_ turns to one. and then you have to say t_v_ channel one, or something. not just one, okay, no speech recognition.do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? yeah, i think so. if you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, it lights up when it's dark? if you push something, it it all lights up. it it mustn't work all the time. it it have to work only when you use it. if you use one button, it must turn on for twenty seconds, and then it must turn off. it's the same as the telephone. yeah. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. teletext options are only four buttons or something. because you ne almost never use it. but younger people i think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext. i use te teletext every day, i think. and i think, 'cause we don't have that many buttons, we just keep it one level then?trendwatching. you know what you have to do.you know what you have to do. trendwatching.could i think of favourites? i always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number. but if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. so you might as well remember the number. maybe i maybe it's too complicated, i would find it handy, i think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six. but how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button? if i use my telephone, i never use those buttons to to to call if i don't do it, maybe old people they don't like new features. right.the working design. the method i used is search the web. just the web page provided. basically what happens is you press a button, then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch. and by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows what bu button is pressed. then the chip produces a pattern. like a morse code and and sends that to the l_e_d_. and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light. and transmit that to the t_v_. we we also have to have a led li led light on it? ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting? red's l shows up like something's wrong, and green is like it's okay, on most remote controls it's red. the energy source is the battery, basically. that's connecting to all the components. the subcomponent is w i i think it is the button pressed. when you press a button, a switch get closed. so the chip knows what button you pressed. and the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb. so that's the led, l_e_d_.the whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons. i i think the batteries will be a little we have a recharger in it, if we can still make that then it's just to indicate something's on. that it's working. we can make the normal one also a normal light. not a led light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. so you see green if you push that button. i think it's unnecessary power you use then. but does it make any difference for the energy you use? i it it will look different, is leds beneath the the buttons? yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even. the same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean? it it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much. maybe that's a good idea for old people as well. it's only few leds. only four or something. four led. but if we use a battery station, yeah, that's a good idea, okay.and the receptor in the t_v_ senses the pattern. so we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. so that it can be used with all the t_v_s. we have to really understand what patterns are used, otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, the chip is producing the pattern. so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to an automatically search function for each television, or something. i dunno how it's exactly how it works. i i use a universal remote control, and you have to put in a number, i have a modern one. and the modern one you you you type search, and after a short time the television turns off. and then you know, oh it it's the right one. we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. that's when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern. but ma basically for brands of t_v_ these patterns are different. what you have to do is get these patterns right. what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television. and when it's switched off, you can push a button as it's working now, and then he saves that settingand the the forty plus people, i already told you. oh, this is a problem. oh sorry about that. the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. so it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's it changes things. i just i just didn't read it well. that kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. i think the thing in the dark is a good way, to make it more like a mobile phone. more modern.but the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. spongy, like sponge. so rubber, kind of. soft materials. but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. but i didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball.it's very difficult to to to do it. because it's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control. that's the problem. that's the main problem. maybe we watch the first the next two presentations. actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. but maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, i think it would be better to implement l_c_d_ as well. since you have to configure speech thing. but a telephone also have a l_c_d_ and and it's about t two hundred euros. we have to decide on that. i got an email and it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced. they say a display requires an advanced chip. and this is more expensive than all the other chips. and speech recognition? yeah, probably too. i i haven't got anything about speech recognition,i just want to give you mike again, the first presentation i received an email and i searched on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. it has been done in italy italy and in another country in europe, but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. so it's very important for us to create something new. fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. this aspect is the most important one. it is twice important as the following. the second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative. that stands for new technical features. and then that this is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of l_c_d_ or speech recognition. but we already have the flashing flashing light the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. we already discussed that. d our our target group we thought about was young and trendy. so i took that part of the webpage. and it says fashion-watchers of pari france and italy, yeah, have detected the following trends. this trends i th trend i think it's not that meaningful for us, maybe. but it's about clothes and shoes. but the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. spongy, like sponge. so rubber, kind of. soft materials. but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. but i didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball. because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control, i think about changeable fronts. maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. and some basic colour fronts. maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. just another shape than a normal remote control ha has. we have to discuss about that. main point stillbut they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. so it's very important for us to create something new. this aspect is the most important one.we're going to talk about the conceptual model. i just show you the m the no the the the the the the minutes, minute. we just talked about it looks. has to look nice. usability is very important. people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. it has to be very basic, not too many buttons. light switches on if you use a button. text t_v_ still has to be a possibility. and it has to be easy to learn. and the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute button, and a text t_v_ button. that are the functions.i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. that's for the next one.actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. it's very difficult to to to do it. but maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, i think it would be better to implement l_c_d_ as well. you mean these to the low? but i i think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. yeah, just th th th other buttons like text t_v_. put that on the button bottom. m maybe we cho should put that on top, i think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. maybe you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy. it doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. but i think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, but but i i think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. i think it will only look more like the old remote controls. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. do we s keep that? it it would be would be a good feature feature.like a very big scroll-wheel. but just not on the top, but on the side of it. i think you'll get a a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted. maybe you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy. i think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. it doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. i think zapping is the highest priority. but i think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, but but i i think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. so so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning time. we have to care that it r looks really new. because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control. 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. but i i it should be round in in shape. if we do it like that we have below have we a lot of room to put a nice logo. you have to look at that image of the ipod. and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? maybe you can buy separate ones buy the product. you buy, you get one. and basic. y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? you could put it like that, so top down. do we have to design that w as well? the docking station? but th yeah, that can be very simple. least. but we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. as long as it isn is in two d_ we can use all kind of round shapes. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. ifor volume. for volume, or a channel. here we have also side scrolls. the scroll wheels, that's cool. that's for the volume.we still want to have a recharger, don't we? re recharger. base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. so the energy is the recharger. just a normal battery.maybe maybe make the the the wha what's it called scroll wheel. make it in in yellow or something. just like the colours of real reaction.it it could be like a nokia, like plastic. with the hard hard buttons. so that should be hard plastic. we just make it plastic. just hard plastic? the case is just a plastic one.the component design. i looked at some similar devices, and my own common knowledge. this was on the web site. if you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. so flashy kinda colours. shapes should be curved, so round shapes. not nothing square-like. ipod is trendy. and it is well curved square. we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. and sports and gaming device style characteristics.the buttons. normal rubber i think. like normal ordinary buttons. soft. it it could be like a nokia, like plastic. with the hard hard buttons. i think rubber really has an odd look. the the the new new modern remote controls, the buttons are part of the the style, i think is part of the remote control itself. it don't come out of the on the background. it's it's all on one level. so that should be hard plastic. but maybe you can m make a round fluff or soft material. basic remote control from normal plastic, the rounds of it from softer s the normal infrared l_e_d_ i think s sufficient. and back light l_e_d_s. but i think there are multiple colour leds. and in green colour, the back lights just make it some different colours. blue, red and green, or something.but just in two d_, not in depth. more rounded. but i i it should be round in in shape. you have to look at that image of the ipod. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. the colours also. so we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public. maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. can't we use different fron fronts, with all with the the logo on it? can we do that? so like fronts in in red and yellow and blue still still transparent. yeah. but with all with logo on it. but anyways it should be transparent. just like a mobile phone, you can make different fronts on it. just give five with them, just in a box. five different but y you could you could make 'em like blue and transparent.i don't think that's an opportunity.i had to make a sort of a design. i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls. so i did some searching on the internet. this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players. mobile phones. just modern modern but still basic. you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. and here you just have one, few buttons. i definitely think we should go like this. and then changeable fonts, it's the most important part, i think. and the home base is something like that, something simple. and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit. basic buttons. on-off, mute. and th maybe two others, i dunno. text buttons. and then the colour buttons, if we want it on. i don't find it very usable, and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the ipod. they can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. and f above ten. that's on on the display. that th there is no display there. but it's on the place of the display. and i think we should light this up much more than that part. my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. m_p_ three player. if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we i don't think we should put it on top then. i think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open. if you put in speech recognition, you need so more many more buttons.i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. that's for the next one. but you definitely get a specific instruction. but th think about something that's more rounded. yeah, five. let's give five.can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, probably we need a advanced chip then. it it would be would be a good feature feature.so you don't see all the buttons you else need. but it sounds very difficult to use. because the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. so you can't use your thumb for it. here we have also side scrolls. i dunno if we can use that. do we want to use for volume. for volume, or a channel. then we can even simplify it more. by just putting the volume on the side. and and just channel buttons here. the channel buttons are often used. and you can't use them now with your thumb, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom. yeah, just th th th other buttons like text t_v_. put that on the button bottom. you mean these to the low? except from the on-off button. but i i think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. so maybe we can put that on the bottom. i think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top. i think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. i think th the the top buttons are okay. they sh those should be on top. but we we can switch those two,but i think we have to make the case transparent, you can just make them around the buttons the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in. we still want to have a recharger, don't we? re recharger. base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. it's just batteries, it's dark in the room. but you mostly use it indoors, or we can also use solar cells. for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic like with the pulse watch. cases, flat, so uncurved. two d_ curved is like front to the back. and three d_ curved is also in depth. but with three d_ curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. so we can't use the flat buttons. these kinda materials can be used. we just make it plastic. and the l_c_d_. we need the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an l_c_d_. i don't think that's an opportunity. are are we using a a rubber case, i don't think a rubber case looks the trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh fresh. fruit and veg can be just the covers. i can't imagine a soft remote control. titanium, i think it's too expensive. just hard plastic? not the sh the square form. you can make it curved or round. but just in two d_, not in depth. more rounded. so the energy is the recharger. we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. what exactly. just a normal battery. the case is just a plastic one. yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one. and we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel.and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? yeah, five. let's give five.yeah, we just made a word file with the basic elements. simply a square with round corners. the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent. the functions are just basic. mute function, on-off function, text functions. and the logo is over here, and the mic. so how many functions do you need for for the microphone? yeah, speech recognition. i didn't have a specification of that. but i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. only one button to say it's on or off. yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. so on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know. it's twelve buttons. f the form well, we've taken that from the ipod, other popular technical device. we'll use hard plastic. since that allows us to use two d_ buttons, non-rubber buttons. we have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. and also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.are we doing the the speech recognition? okay, but it's still possible financially. okay yeah. well then then we're gonna put it in. or are we making a slide open, like underneath? slide open is quite usable for remote controls. it's may maybe a bit stronger as well. yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. no, you have a different chip for speech recognition. so so i already calculated that and it's still in the budget.so these are the last notes we i made. f you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. if anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then.okay, maybe we use this button for the okay, there is one function i use daily, and it's not on the basic functions. it's to switch to your scart. just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. right, the video channel, play station, etcetera. that's used pretty often. so here are multiple speech buttons, i don't know how many. menu buttons with arrows. maybe one button to switch the colour of your leds? colour buttons. yeah, maybe some some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. there's one text button i prefer. that's the one that you use if you search for a page, like seven hundred, and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. if you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? that's a functionality for the television. the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. th th th if you switch it on.we have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. and also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know. it's twelve buttons.digital pen is horrible. but if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, i think. just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. but you might as well do it in normal computer style.colour changeable, and also transparent.i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. i think that was the m biggest problem.it's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. like the prices. if we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker.well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. and h how does the second level come out? it slides along?okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. so i think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three euros. but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or can we make that for h twenty cents? the b the button supplements, i didn't i d i was wondering if this special colour maybe was but this is expensive, the sample speaker. is that included? in the twelve euro orso how many functions do you need for for the microphone? yeah, speech recognition. i didn't have a specification of that. but i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. only one button to say it's on or off. yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. so so here are multiple speech buttons, i don't know how many.yeah, i made some criteria, so we can ev evaluate our model. and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. we sh we we we can give it a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our and we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. if it's really, if you can if you can get the ipod look, then it's beautiful, i think. the basic colours are black or green or yellow? maybe company colours? a bit a bit of yellow. yeah, grey. just dark grey i think. changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. okay, just give it a two. the fancy look-and-feel. and we can change the colours, so that's really fancy i think. it's pretty cool. if you slide it open, it lights up. and th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. i think it's one. learnable? easy to use? it's it's very easy to use, but the second layer is not easy to use. and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. because because i think i think the scroll wheel, it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. then a two. new features. techno technological innovative? and the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. the speech function is new. and the slide. i think the slide is pretty new. but then we also have the the home station. we are forgetting about that now, but yeah, we didn't draw that too, but okay. and new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? no, just so it's still a two. yeah, but did we reach, with our style, the targeted audience? you get the fancy things for younger people. and you get the the aesthetic things for older people. but we didn't follow the latest trends. yeah, you could make a a front like a a f banana kind of front. so we giveit's twelve buttons. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know.i think just i just write a final report. fill in the questionnaire.the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent.so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for for everything together. was there room for creativity? i yeah, i think so. yeah m if we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity i think we discussed a lot of things about it. so okay, so the leadership just normal discussion, i think. not one leader or something. team work the third meeting i think that one was pretty hard. we were not all we were not agree with every not agree with. i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. i think that was the m biggest problem. like the prices. if we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker. but the teamwork was okay. yeah, everybody could speak their opinion. i think everyone listen to each other. the smart board is okay. digital pen is horrible. but if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, i think. just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. but you might as well do it in normal computer style. new ideas found. i don't know what it mean. to gather, or to work together, or new ideas for yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. because we don't have any sizes and yeah, but it you can't possibly do that in such a short time, i think. yeah, this this is just the idea phase,and the marketing expert should come up with user requirements. therefore we have to to do some internet search. for example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions?this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design. the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera.and it seems you get more information by email.we can sell them at twenty five euros.the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million euros.and the production cost should be the half of the selling price.i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video. and reserve the possibility to add other features.we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. we should take some practice. i have some instructions now to do that. you know how to the documents work. this for toolbar. you see it next. and we can use this pen to perform. it doesn't always work. and in the format menu you can select colour and line width, etcetera etcetera. each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal. you should explain with different colours and with different pen widths. and you should explain why you draw that particular animal. different pen widths, how do you do that? with the format menu. and use different colours etcetera. it's a giraffe. yeah. can you use one blank sheet per drawing? or so y you must save it at the end you can press the next button, i in the file option menu. is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? introduction and get acquainted i'm guessing a turtle. how to select the next or colours were under format a fox yeah. it's a cat.let's get started. opening acquaintance, tool training, how to use the things here. project plan discussion, and yeah then the rest of the meeting. we're supposed to develop a new remote control, that's both original, trendy and user-friendly. we're work we're working from top to bottom. functional design, then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera etcetera. and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up.and i'll see you again when the computer tells us to. let's see what we got to do.i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there, which i know, there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. you need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. and you you don't need that for a t_v_. and and for a t teletext you need additional buttons as well, so i kind of need to know what we need. and then we can discuss it with the next meeting. we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video. and reserve the possibility to add other features. so we have a basic starting point so make sure it's extendible. yeah. and you can always extend that it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. th the least amount of functions possiblethe user interface designer should specify the technical functions.we each have a specific task, i didn't know if you received the same mail. as i saw in my mail. this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design. the user interface designer should specify the technical functions. and the marketing expert should come up with user requirements. did any of you already do some work on this part i started making an overview for myself, what i had to do, and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever. 'cause we have three design steps and what did the marketing expert do? from a marketing perspective, well the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements. what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? there are a few means to reach that by by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market. i mean, what functions do they have. especially what are their shortcomings? are there any new functions which can be added to our product? therefore we have to to do some internet search. for example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions? and we can interview current users and future users. what w what would they like to see on a new remote control? especially for future users, i'm thinking of early adopters, because they they use new technology first, but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are? no n not specifically.we have a financial aspect to this project. we can sell them at twenty five euros. the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million euros. that's quite a big amount of money. and the production cost should be the half of the selling price. now it's time for some discussion. i'm taking notes.the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera. i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session? do we only have to to do phase one, the functional design? after that we are going to the conceptual we have meeting, individual work, meeting. and at the end of the day we have a final meeting. i mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? i think that is the user requirements part. as to what they want. do they want all those functions on that small but but we need good communication about this stuff, so if i don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard.and do you have any ideas about the product so far? i started i started with the first phase, i had to focus on the working design, which you said. i basically had two points. according to the coffee machine example, i have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_. i got another point. it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo. it's some buttons for for the on off function. and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. that are the the basic options for a remote control. i mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. i got some requirements it has it has to be user-friendly. really easy to use buttons, not not very small buttons, but not the the also the big big buttons, it has to be a small unit. you can take it with you everywhere in in your house. and a and a good zapping range. the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance. i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment. i think we can go ahead with what we have. i will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want yeah so what we might wanna do is yeah cust i have customised the screen functions, if you know what i mean. the the simple functions for for the the whole public, and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with you can make a if you make a drawing. basic. so it should fit right in into your hand. okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, and the screen is below, and the buttons are in the middle. but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top, and for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone. yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. so we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo i mean this is basically numbers, volume, channel up and down. yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and and image options right? so channel programming? yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour. s swap channels? swap's good option. that's very good idea. hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons? so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry, is if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice. so maybe make one one okay button and and one navigation button. yeah okay. so on the on the top is better. depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but i think that's okay.but it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. and the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.i w i should put the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display. under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, according to the old principle. and the l_c_d_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared decoder yeah. yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour.i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need. this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well i was working on this before i got my information. so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. and well the info on the website which came too late. but yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow, so i was trying to organise them for myself.the user interface designer can design a menu for all these function and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on thehey what's wrong with my computer? i think you have to change your desktop yeah my computer is not functioning properly. did you plug in the power cable when you come back? you pressed alt f_ four? no no no. i pressed the mouse button.i'm gonna talk about functional requirements. well some research has be done has been done. observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. and they also filled in a questionnaire. they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. users think they're ugly. they are often lost somewhere in the room. it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. and they're bad for r_s_i_. they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users.and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes.most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass. most relevant, most used functions, power button, channel, volume selection. teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future.and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech menu button access the menu in the l_c_d_ screen.well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups, nice design, which does not make the remote control in your room.all the functional aspects of the remote i think are in my department.okay. so he's layout and you're function. isn't that more the the u the user interface part? i think that's a that's a good separation. yeah we have to kind of work together.by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from? i receiv the mail but you don't. so no so it's a text file n in the project folder. and the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. but it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.and the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. it should be designed for a use g group below forty, the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen. sixteen to forty.i had two examples. this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. this the easy one i think we have to to combine them. and yeah merge the best functions of all examples. okay so so we have the option for more functions. yeah but i prefer we we use the the basic options yeah. we have to to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button. yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed. so maybe you can hide them or something. so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, with a clear menu. so we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionableyeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour. menu button access the menu in the l_c_d_ screen. and then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate.and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech so what does the screen do? for for the advanced functions i think. well i, my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced advanced functions.yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for t_v_.but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for t_v_.well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well i was working on this before i got my information. so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. and well the info on the website which came too late. but yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow, so i was trying to organise them for myself. i mean everything speaks for itself i guess. mean you press a button the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies. and the t_v_ will translate it into a function.i thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display and four cursors. most of the time you have one button in the middle. it says menu, and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level.hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons? so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. that's very good idea.so we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo yeah okay. so on the on the top is better.so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.you will do the evaluation. you probably get a mail. yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow.but basically you two are going to work on the smartboard. next thirty minutes to design something so so we're gonna work here? on this sketchboard?most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. instead of the current functional look-and-feel. and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, and the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. i first chose for the battery, 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious, easiest choice to go to. but i really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy,advanced chip. okay.so welcome to the marketing presentation once again. fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public, because that's our public. fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing, shoes and furniture. and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey. oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. instead of the current functional look-and-feel. and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, and the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing, and and some fruit and colours just made a quick design.the case would be doubly curved. so rubber material.i didn't get any information about that so i'm just thinking, this is not my department, but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost, advanced chip. okay. rubber material. the case would be doubly curved. so so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. do you have a picture of doubly curved case? this is the the menu i was looking at. s see this is the the the standard traditional type, where the form yeah serves the function, you know. but this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that. and th that means curved in both dire dire dimensions. where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold. and th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. so yeah but that's that's the the problem yeah the dilemma actually, 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, and with a lot of shape. yeah, and the and the rubber, it it will look cheap always, okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the the buttons. if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it. and this is, this is with the curved that i mean. well we could make a compromise between that. instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. so to appeal a little more to the all the public. yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? i would go for the double curved. i mean our aim is to make something different right? and i i'm i'm thinking you know a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb. but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. you can make a trigger button or something like that. and we need something that well that that you can ableone one very important thing i was yeah thinking about is the speech option. i think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present. but do j do we do the speech just for the basic options, for the simple buttons? for for everything, in the in the last meeting we we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated. pressing the the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control. and only the the l_c_d_ panel will light up and then you can only change the yeah the options. but this is the the the simple layout. display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button. and if there are older people they wanted more yeah more luxurous so that's an a also an option.so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. the case would be doubly curved. so rubber material.i'm dealing with the components design. i used some design examples we had from similar products. for example the energy source. we have four types. the basic battery. we have a hand dynamo, the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it. and of course solar cells. for the a case, there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case. single curved, which means that it has curves in one dimension. or the double curved. but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now. well we have all kinds of hard materials like the the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium. i would definitely go for rubber we have yeah several interface designs. we can use a scroll buttons for the menus, but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons, for the the arrow buttons. the advanced chip i think is easiest to implement for the production, 'cause they they can print it better. i can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make. but it is more longlasting, that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again. and especially when the material's rubber. it can be done, i mean, you can't harm it, no it means curved in two dimensions. so double curved is like this, this, this, or so w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the the buttons. if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it. how about we do a a pop-up screen, like the laptop. if you can flip. but i dunno if that's too expensive. okay so the buttons are on top here, and you flip it over that way. and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically. so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. well yeah the the idea of it was, is that because you close it, you cover the l_c_d_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever. we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break. i don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? like some soft green or something? orange or something. and then and then very bright, a yellow banana, an orange, a green apple, stuff like that, yeah w we need very primary colours, like bright red, bright yellow. yeah but the primary colours w we can create with the with the leds on the on the remote control. if you make it just a yeah bl give it a blue colour, then it's just a neutral colour, so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess. yeah with some some yellow banana i mean, the the colour of the background of the display? so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. maybe a maybe a white a white backlight? but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours? so th the total of the thing is very bright? but then then again, which colour should the buttons be? but maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people. red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate. even for colourblindinstead of doubly curved we take a single curved. so to appeal a little more to the all the public. well we could make a compromise between that. yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? i would go for the double curved. i mean our aim is to make something different right? but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. so then you have double double curved in some way.i'm just thinking, this is not my department, but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost, i didn't get any information about that soso double curved is like this, this, this, or no it means curved in two dimensions. so w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.. i did get a bit more done than the last time, 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the sometimes i have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there, and also with i don't know how to use powerpoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it.oh yeah, we have to do the project evaluation. so how were did the project process go? did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? yeah well at first i was really stressed. because it went a bit fast. but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on, the second time i think i did a bit better. because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. and then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. so the process, i mean, the interaction between us became better and better i guess. yeah. especially after the first meeting. well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of the the board and powerpoint and word and stuff like that. so and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the smartboard. because it it it just works better. but the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. and as i said, i have no idea how powerpoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation. okay, are are there any new ideas about this? it's use especially useful, i guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. i think the powerpoint is is too limited. yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. yeah. but it it's useful tothe process, i mean, the interaction between us became better and better i guess. yeah. especially after the first meeting.makes three point one one one one one one one. so we're better than average.yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this okay we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? yeah we we can just use this one. and then over-paint it with the green the the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. oh and you might want to add a infrared led. well i have to make an report of every decision we made so far. and i try to get chip just before i receive the excel sheet. but maybe you can help me. okay, but how do we make the the scroll button? the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance. it's not very fashionable anymore. but it's okay. maybe that's a s a special colour for it. so we can make it special? can we do a print? i'm not sure. shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? we have the original balance sheet, or okay, it's not the prettiest, i know. maybe maybe it c it can say that. the real remote. shall we do the logo in black or not? well it's it's single single curved. but it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice.that was exactly my point. like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway. so we'll just have to use it for everything. integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. if you lose the the back, the okay button v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the menu button. with with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing. yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. so okay. make it a special colour and then it look fancy.i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? i don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. yeah, but there are no negative questions i guess. so it were all positive questions, by by purpose. so yeah true. yes, so the it tells us something, yes.was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means ofit's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing.we all have to keep in mind what has changed now. so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements. well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale, as following. well the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. and we all have to agree on a certain level. well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. i think it does. because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l_c_d_, okay well i say still two, but it has to be three then. the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. yeah. well, yeah. so it it's a very true point. i mean it hides all those function. it shows the relevant and most used functions. it automatically has the the programme and the volume function, okay five. the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition. yeah, i say two. okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. so we still we still have the primary colours. but only on the on the outside, not on the button. yeah still we we dropped also on the the double curve. it should have been two questions. i realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped.. so maybe in the middle or something. actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. i mean the sponge-like and the three d_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. the remote control displays the corporate logo. but there's enough space for the corporate logo. i mean, if there's only one thing. and even the shape we have now simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_, the remote control is easy to use. skill, i would say six, or something. i don't think it's easy to use, or notdo we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. but we don't have any basic options any more. they don't need special colours. so let's go for the plastic. so the only option is an hand dynamo. drop the the special colour, and do the special colour for the buttons. yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour.yeah, i have still ten minutes to finish the report.i mean we're gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway. so we'll just have to use it for everything. could drop the speech recognition. there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen. yeah. let's drop the speech.the the board and powerpoint and word and stuff like that. so and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the smartboard. because it it it just works better. but the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. and as i said, i have no idea how powerpoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation. i think the powerpoint is is too limited. yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. yeah. but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then tookay. first of all i'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. because we have a problem. it has to be twelve and a half. you're going to redesign something. okay, so we're at twenty five.because we have a problem. it has to be twelve and a half. you're going to redesign something. okay, so we're at twenty five.so the only option is an hand dynamo. let's let's go for the hand dynamo then.i mean we have to drop on everything. another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. but we don't have any basic options any more. but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. could drop the speech recognition. there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen.yeah. let's drop the speech.integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. with with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing.so let's go for the plastic.\""

       "\"okay,, first is the functional design, this is where we all go off and do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product,, conceptual design, and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work.we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board, and sum up the characteristics of that animal. i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger., maybe you can guess what i'm trying to make? a kind of dog? okay, now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile. it's meant to be an eagleyeah, i don't i don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l_c_d_ thing anyway, i'd assume. the other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control i think that's a cost thing,i'm sarah, the project manager okay, this is our agenda, get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know., we want it to be original,, trendy, appealing to a wide market, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful, so you've got a little l_c_d_ display. instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an l_c_d_ di display or something like that, what about the older generation? that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps, i don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system. i find it really confusing, yeah, i don't i don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l_c_d_ thing anyway, i'd assume.and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know? something that's easily moulded and produced. about what you're saying about the does does it need to be fashionable? i i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the we put the fashion into electronics, i mean you don't you you can still have plastic we don't have to use metal, and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic, i mean there's sky remote controls and everything. they're kind of moulded so yeah i guess that's stuff we can think about.finance-wise, we've got a selling price at twenty five euros, which i don't actually know what that is in pounds, at all. seventeen. okay, that's expensive. havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. production cost's at twelve fifty, so, and profit aim is fifty million euros, you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a accessible and usable by sort of all age groupswhat are your experiences with remote controls? i mean i've got we got we had three videos, a t_v_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good, the fact that you could you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and symbols that you don't necessarily understand, so simplification of symbols you could think of. and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it. the other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote controlso we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. and then we'll come back and liaise again okay,, first is the functional design, this is where we all go off and do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effects the product has to have, th the shape you got trendy. i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, what i was thinking of a design which nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back. so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, so it's like you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. i wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. i mean for example, if it was a c_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague c_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, you know even though we're using plastic, you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, you could have different kind of casings. so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designsbut just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing t_v_ remote controls with with their design features,, chain companies like carphone warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it i press for this? th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but i i'm not sure how much the cost would be of having i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that. instruction manuals. there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possibleokay, so the remote control functions. we've got the t_v_, we've got the video, now there's i can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, video plus. we could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, and you wouldn't you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that, i've not come across that function if you look in the newspaper, t_v_ guide or any t_v_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards i'm not sure if we need a design decision now,, what other functions? oh batteries, that's what i was thinking about. mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something,, something like that should reduce the size of it. yeah if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? rechargeable with a docking station. and we've talked about there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost,.further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. i'm thinking kind of japan, i'm thinking young, office people,we have new project requirements, we're not going to be using teletext, our control is only going to be for t_v_, it's not going to be a combined control, i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but i don't know, what do you think? would that imply video use? but i mean, general t_v_ controls do do video as well. i think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. so we want logo, we want fashionable, trendy,i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab, our findings, lots of findings, i've just summarised some of them here. the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls,, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, but that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking., current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. for example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier, remote controls are often lost in the room, fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use, slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury. the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid i think in when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. something we didn't put to them, but which i'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. so thirty fives and unders who, and the rechargeable batteries. rechargeable with a docking station. so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? you could have different kind of casings. so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that.yeah. actually some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention, but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we'll take a feedback from the marketing and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. so what the concept is to have a flip-top model. the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. if you ask me personally, i would make flip-top with a trendy design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that. and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hardju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing yeah but on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it isand i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless, most of them are powered by some form of battery. now our one, i'm i'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control. you're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones, now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the u_i_ interface which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the t_v_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the t_v_s are already using so all the components that i've put forward are low in cost it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have,okay this is the working design, what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design? well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel or the volume, everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to., so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. but although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands outand the i the instruction manual, i don't know if we deal with that,. what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?i think we have to design one product th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely.i'm thinking young, office people, i'm thinking kind of japan,i mean for example, if it was a c_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague c_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, i think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, something about videoplus. video plus.i'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed. do we agree on the battery? the kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it., that means that there's no function for li the port, i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, the l_c_d_'s not cheap. maybe we could start with the black and white. the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? did we decide on double a_ or triple a_ batteries? the kinetic ones come come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. yeah the well i think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one, on the buttons, on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. for the body design i think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, this would definitely be different enough, i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little and incorporating the company logo? 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product i think you just address that with advertising. obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everythingokay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, so it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers i am here.so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. yeah, depending on the expense of it. have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?do we agree on the battery? the kinetic., that means that there's no function for li the port, the l_c_d_'s not cheap. maybe we could start with the black and white. the kinetic ones come come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. did we decide on double a_ or triple a_ batteries? yeah the well i think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one, on the buttons, on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. for the body design i think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, this would definitely be different enough, you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your littlethis is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and then we we're loo looking into battery options. there's actually no rechargeable option available, i saw the the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest, so you wind up your remote control before you use it. like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t_v_. i'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. but i i think i think the the next one's the best anyway. the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, it like it runs for long time? well i do i d i'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i've never seen one run out. referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries? ye yeah i think i th g y you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest w w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. 'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing shouldn'tand so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan. so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. now i should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials,we are going to have m maybe a g_ g_u_i_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. so you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. and second thing is there's too much of confusion here. basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? so the findings are too many cluttered buttons. repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained, okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, so it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers i am here. so i wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular patternthe the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, 'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research, but it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. there's the plastic which i think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing so perhaps some something made of rubber,'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. there's actually no rechargeable option available,we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. there's actually no rechargeable option available,the minutes from the last time. we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. we were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost,the kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, yeah the well i think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one, on the buttons, on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.prototype presentation. me and william worked on a prototype, and i think william is going to make a p presentation on that. i can hold it like and i'll i'll show you the presentation. and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there. it's gonna have a a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be sort of a wide choice the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and the the top l_c_d_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top the black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. we've already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, we decided that the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. so you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, i'm here, or something. the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the t_v_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate p_c_b_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. and because, obviously, all t_v_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. and the infrared sender would be on the on onewe decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, 'cause it can come in various different sizes, we wanted a stand-by function. the case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. buttons with a combination of l_c_d_ and rubber according to the design. bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-r_s_i_.but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. if you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. we could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. i don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. we can put in our recommendations. if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers so if we take voice recognition out that'll do it. twelve point three five. we are close to the budget. is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? so we are under the budget.i've got finance here now. we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. so are we still on for kinetic? yeah. see, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. it might have influenced our choice. it was a regular chip on print you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. one double curve. 'cause it's two. what's a single curve then? it would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. we've got plastic and rubber, i think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, see, it says case material. we're not actually using plastic in the case, there's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. special colour, do we need that? might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. the push-button's one and l_c_ display one. i think we could change the battery also. instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? so the highest we've got is the electronics here. and the interface. if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? it it would make one difference. what i feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. if you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three.do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? i don't think so. we happy to go ahead? i think we yeah. i think we're set. i think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, i'll just leave it there. and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.i've now got evaluation criteria. this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, we're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the market w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. i won't write all of that out again. it will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. so i'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. criteria a_, the fancy look and feel. my own rating for that would be a two. two and three quarters? criteria b_, criterion b_, technologically innovative. i would give that a three. i'd give it a one. it's just two point five for that one. ease of use. based on what you've said there, i would say awe could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. i don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. we can put in our recommendations. if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers so if we take voice recognition out that'll do it. twelve point three five.we decided that the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. so you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, i'm here, or something. though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, yeah, it was it was a voice voice recognition, and are we happy with the costs on that? that is going to be feasible, cost-wise. yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible.there's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with,if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,we happy to go ahead? i think we yeah. i think we're set. i think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.and now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.the black and white touch screen the top screen, as we said, is would be an inset black and white l_c_d_ s touch screenit's gonna have a a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, which there'd be sort of a wide choicei think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. we see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. there are innovations in that that people don't really want. and i think it's wonderful our company's so r_ and d_ based.i think we had a nice time. although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. yeah, i think there was very constructive feedback by everybody. we came to a very predic creative design, yeah. and sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, i think maybe it would've come out a d little different, i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model.product evaluation. we've done room for creativity, because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. although we had our separate tasks, i think we had a nice time. there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. yeah, i think there was very constructive feedback by everybody. we came to a very predic creative design, yeah. and sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, i think maybe it would've come out a d little different, i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model.and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. there's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with,it might have influenced our choice. see, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, do you think that's takes into account overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? and the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? i think it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone. i think we've done very well to get within budgetsee, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. it might have influenced our choice. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. is this a mun multi-functional one i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. that's true, but at this point in time i think you're right that shall we make it just a t_v_.marketing, the user requirement specification.work has been done on this project where by twenty five euros is the expected selling price. so we're looking to sell internationally, not just in europe. we're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half euro per unit. and therefore making a profit margin of well not actually a profit margin it's because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from from that to give you your profit margin per unit. and so depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time.so we've got tool training. try out whiteboard. right so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. i guess this is make sure the whiteboard works. do you wish to go f have a first bash at whatever. i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because i dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear i'm gonna go for the dog, so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got a few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw.right, so agenda of the first meeting. where we we have twenty five minutes for this meeting. so does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required? so tool training. project plan. i'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. neither am i. so we have the project team, which is to basically to come up with a new r remote control device. and our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one, and to to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design in each of these phases we'll basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this this device. and having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better better inst implement than we had before.we are to get acquainted. so does everyone want to say who they are? i'm robin. i'm the marketing manager. i'm louisa. i'm the user interface designer. i'm nick. i am the industrial designer. and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader.okay, so we've got the working design for i_d_.i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. is this a mun multi-functional one i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. that's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. but at this point in time i think you're right that shall we make it just a t_v_.specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach. okay, so we've got the working design for i_d_. for u_i_d_ the technical functions design. marketing, the user requirement specification.experience with remote control, first ideas. new remote. so i guess we're looking at having a discussion at this point in time so any any thoughts? i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons. okay, so so basically we're looking for some we're looking for a device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily. sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. because a lot of systems are kind of t_v_ video combined now, is this just a television remote? or t_v_ d_v_d_ combined. and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. so if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. basically i'll get back to you on that. one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room. so a device for for all remotes. and sometimes they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. we need to sort of maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room. comes to your whistle. that's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but maybe we could have better instructions with the remote. i mean we've done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, you can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all. and so these are probably mutually exclusive options you could arguefor u_i_d_ the technical functions design.well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen those remotes where kind of the bottom bit slides down, so there's kind of everything else revealed? so you don't use it that much, that is that is a good idea actually. so so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back. and that'll be better for the older generation as well so we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. the detailed ones would be sort of brightness, and then at the back? you've got brightness and contrast. maybe if we're gonna run out of time, one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. there's audio functions. you're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. and then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.well shall we look into that and just get back together.well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, i think clapping,and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers.so so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back.the detailed ones would be sort of brightness, so on front, about the number. the volume up and down. a mute button as well. and probably a power one as well. so so are you having the stand-by on the front, then? are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick, so. volume is twelve, numbers is ten, and a mute, yeah. and then at the back? you've got brightness and contrast. there's audio functions. you're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. and then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.so anything that is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. because time to market is is critical. s but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. d d i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible.so we've got new project requirements. so basically we've got three things, and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options. w i i got or or three things basically, relating to the remote being only for t_v_. we discussed that last time we've got teletext outdated. right and the corporate image was the final thing. so i i got that in email form.so having researched the existing models within the market, i found my research off the internet. i've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which i guess in most existing models would be a battery supply. there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. and then the sender, which is usually, i've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remoteokay i'm gonna be looking at the working design. i've just got three sections, first is the research i made on the on the remote control itself. and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual the actual remote. so having researched the existing models within the market, i found my research off the internet. i've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which i guess in most existing models would be a battery supply. we then have the user interface, which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. the various functions used for changing channel, channel up and down, volume, things like that. there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. and then the sender, which is usually, i've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's obviously found in the television. i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working, a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remote so this is the user interface. and then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. which then, and that's the that's the infra-red sender. going on to personal preferences, i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red has been used quite successfully. and then the sender,and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. so anything that is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. s but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. d d i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible.. okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed. here are two example remotes. by the look of it they both have kind of play and fast forward, rewind functions, so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. but as you can see, the left remote is quite quite busy looking, quite complicated. whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly. so my personal preference would be the right remote. it's got a very limited number of buttons. so, it's got nice big buttons, i like the use of the kind of symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the kind of play functions and all that. so it's very very user friendly, but i got i got an email that basically said to make sure that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan. we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme.but we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, well i think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of kind of whistle back kind of function. i don't really know about the voice recognition thing. clapping, i think clapping, 'kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button, haven't we? did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers. we could possibly put an l_ a sort of a l_c_d_ menu in, but that again is probably an expense that you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once, so and if finally the t_v_ breaks, you get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it. the the product we've got is something that's at the i would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's terribly high-tech. i mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions, so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. yeah, 'cause you do need kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seengoing on to personal preferences, i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red has been used quite successfully. and then the sender,well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, i think clapping, and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers.we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. and how do people use it? we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s a fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings, they weren't used very often at all. people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control. and young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older, people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions, and to find your way around it. my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power, and also volume and that sort of thing, as as louisa said.would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here, the the sort of circular section, because that seems to be for a video as well. so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. and i don't really think that you need nine numbers. i mean how often do you use seven, eight and nine? i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. well for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for future such channels. but the the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, and there's i don't know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account sky and various other various others. maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels some remotes have kind of favourite options yeah, i s i suppose in a sense you could have if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want but i think a lot of like cable and sky and stuff, that would be tuned to one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. limit the number of buttons, but i suppose nine's not really excessive. you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, how many buttons have we got? we've just got ten, eleven twelve th well we've we've got that it's remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations.and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone, you lose that and you can ring it. maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. so you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is. yeah, we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well, there's key rings that you kind of whistle at or clap at, and then they whistle back, or something like that. that'd probably be really simple, or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. i mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way i was gonna say a sharp noise, you know a clapping of hand or whatever. a set command whatever that happened to be. and you can give it a command, because it'll recognise the voice you could have an option to turn it off. or so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? well if it does then we can't.we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control. and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well, because sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room, rather than sort of having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. what was that last wee bit there? about speech recognition? but that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition..okay, so very brief presentation,. from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly sleek and sexy. i haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there, but there's some curved cases that you can see, a range of sizes. all of them have a lot of buttons there some of the remotes that i looked at, one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions. and it was quite a swish model, i mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing the scroll buttons, as you've already mentioned, there's examples of those, but they don't look as sleek as other models. and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great. th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about,. there was children's remote, where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications. so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features you'd have model one, model two and model three, so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.so i don't think it would effect our circuit board. but the way that i interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. so we'd have a simple circuit board and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board are we going for speech recognition? just just for the call and find thing. it's it's just an addition thing but maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later.that's a that's a decision for all of us.. so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue, i mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were. that's probably a better one, to discuss it straight away. so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance. then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel, the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information.. the scroll wheel required the regular, the display requires an advanced chip and note that the push button just requires a simple chip, yeah, and if we're going for sleek and sexy, i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky? so maybe just a simple push button, yeah, a simple pushbuttons. did everyone get this on the speech recognition? so it is basically the concept we discussed before. but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board. so if we go for the simple push button, so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision. but the way that i interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. so i don't think it would effect our circuit board. so we'd have a simple circuit board and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board w w kinetic. i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries. somehowso if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button. so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board. and for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. if we're gonna have the speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one. i'm guessing. but i don't know, so that is something i'll have to look into.for the components design, next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before. we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. then there is a chip and still the sender. so yes including the power s supply as well. first in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery, there's a dynamo. there's a kinetic option, which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced. but i think that was gonna cost a little more. and then there's solar cells. as a final option. for the buttons, we have an integrated push button, which i guess is just the same as the standard ones. this says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer. there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down, one issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case, what would be the cost do do we know? i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, that that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board. the firm supplies a simple, a regular and an advanced circuit board. so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button. one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition. there's a small unit available through the company which obviously would be an extra cost, going to my personal preferences, i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic and this would avoid batteries running out, having to replace batteries and such like. for the buttons, i thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel. so if we wantedright well from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes, but it didn't work out too well, so maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting, i can quickly give you what we what we had. right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device. we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself, that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time. we're gonna have effectively two pages, a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted, and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements.so maybe just a simple push button, yeah, a simple pushbuttons. alright, so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons, so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply?i guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.i think because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there, and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do, it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function. the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. and and the voice recognition, we can use that can't we, just to find it. without affecting the circuit board.i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. right, i've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them, what was bad, what they used. and we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. so we've had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends. the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional. and second, there should be some technological innovation. and then third and l less important than the other two, there should be an ease of use as well. and apparently, the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme. but the feel of the material should be spongy, we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else. and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap. and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations. so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg, or the the buttons could be spongy, somehow. and then sort of even wackier than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, how how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends, do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget, or or you know, do they not matter that much?say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. maybe that could be a little apple. and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. or veg. could be a red apple, yeah.so we'd stick with the simple circuit boardthere was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design. just to avoid ambiguity. i think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up, they might see yeah, they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down, whereas the actual button's pointing up, so the function is to turn the button up. so, be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them, because they might be kind of two contradicting kind of shapes. so maybe we could have volume written on the sideth there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about,. there was children's remote, where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications. so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features you'd have model one, model two and model three, so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed herei think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped, it might make it more complicated to use. well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons, maybe just one button, i mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design, maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about,. maybe still with a rubber design we could the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change? whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year, it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle. you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that, i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside. oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case, but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme, aren't we? you could have your company badge and logo. i mean a lot of computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of stick on badge and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider. i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a yeari mean a lot of computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of stick on badge you could have your company badge and logo.say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. maybe that could be a little apple. th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people, if you're looking for functionality. if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg, next year's i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever. it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. rubber buttons require rubber case. okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year, you know. it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case, and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel? but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine. one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other. shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? we'll go for single curve, yeah. and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. or veg. so it's not really spongy feel buttons, it's just rubber buttons. could be a red apple, yeah. yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, 'cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain. just to keep the shape of the buttons simple.it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. rubber buttons require rubber case. shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? we'll go for single curve, yeah. and the rubber push buttons, rubber case. yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can,and the speech feature.okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. we've got a rubber case materials supplements.so we're now on to project process. now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which i will do. did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. well, we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings, and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and i don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do this, you do that, you do that. then you go away. you find out information. you then come back. you then discuss it. whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, what do you want to put down? creativity, seemed okay. flow of information on on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed. i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. it was quite good with this the white board, having that and the digital pens. so how do you reckon teamwork went? that went okay, yeah. i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. to go reasonably well.if you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, which gets us in right within the budget range. and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. yeah, i was i was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. so we're going for plastic, yes? oh actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points, we've got nought point eight left, well, we've got special form. now that would be one button, and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special i guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. so, special colour, you want three in there. well i thin i think you you you just need two for the special colour one original colour and then sort of two supplements, i think maybe. maybe that'll be a second supplement. the volume ones should stand out a bit. you were making these buttons down the bottom, i was presuming, bigger than the other ones, and we've got special form is the one apple. then there's a spe a second special form. yeah, that's twelve point three, so i think that should still be okay. well, in this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. well, we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour.we did find a new idea, i mean sort of a kinetic remote control. voice recognition, especially not could you've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. yeah, so it's just like the same products, but just put together in a different way. new ideas found, so one or two. kinetic powered remote control., voice recognition thing.i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. i mean a remote control isn't the most kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. i mean this one seems. from the website it looks it's quite innovative, i don't think sort of the budget allowed us to do anything bit bit arbitrary. well, i mean i don't think it i just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products.so, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on.okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. we've got a rubber case materials supplements. i switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor.and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, so, i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. so, we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. whether it's easy to use. whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. and whether it's a sort of recognisable real reaction product. and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, so the first one is, does the product look and feel fancy. okay, well we have a single curve,, then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time. yeah, i'd maybe give it a a two. what is one false, or is t one true? one's true. so say about a two for fancy, and i mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon?, deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. so it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so i would go for a one on that at this point in time., incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. it's got the cherry and the sponginess. say about a three maybe? the product is a recognisable real r reaction product? i woulda said two would seem reasonable. and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing, as well as having the logoshall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after?so we're going for plastic, yes?well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, i don't know.y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. cherry would be alright actually. we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. and did we make it a cherry officially? yeah. okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. we've got a rubber case materials supplements.it's got the cherry and the sponginess. and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. maybe other ones could be something else shaped. so it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. yeah, i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe.well we've made our prototype anyway. you pass it round to have a look. y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides., it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. cherry would be alright actually. yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. for the first time, well it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons., we just chose simple shapes for all them., the important ones are the volume ones. so we made them a bit bigger. hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the the channel is in blue. and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the the red apple button. so but there would be a cost implication on that, well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white play-doh. yes, we'll have the slide-away., don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. i think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.so decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. so we're going for plastic, yes? lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but, well we've still got the kinetic energy.yeah, i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.well, we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour. i think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine.did you get told what the company colour is or i'm still not quite sure we've established that. so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. so basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product.i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap, well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal.and and it should have multi-purpose. yes, i i feel that all the remote should be very compact. like the remote control which we use for t_v_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different.like the remote control which we use for t_v_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. at twelve fifty euros per well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that.yeah, my name is francina. and i'm an user interface and i'm a marketing person. my name is eileen. yeah. i'm jeanne-oui. my role is industrial designer and as you already know i am betty. i am the project manager for today.i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? yeah, my name is francina. and i'm an user interface and i'm a marketing person. my name is eileen. yeah. i'm jeanne-oui. my role is industrial designer and as you already know i am betty. i am the project manager for today.i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap, well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. and i i think voice or clapping it's not specific enough.it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different. maybe it should different colours or materials or you know.the industrial designer that's you. working design, yeah, it's it's mainly technical-functional design.yes, i i feel that all the remote should be very compact. and and it should have multi-purpose. like the remote control which we use for t_v_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system.the industrial designer that's you. working design, yeah, it's it's mainly technical-functional design. so so you are the working design. so you have a working design and then a functional design. and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. i think basically basically you will get instructions to work with then we see you in about thirty minutes.here's the project finance selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro. profit aim for the company is fifty million euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro. now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thingand the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general.then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. you wanna go eileen and and remember you have to press so it works.so so you are the working design. so you have a working design and then a functional design.here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with. the same goes for the conceptual design, detailed design, same thing basically.profit aim for the company is fifty million euro,this thing we are gonna design is a new remote control. should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly.selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro.the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the t_v_, the v_c_r_, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but if we do some more research, maybe we. if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t_v_. i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody.now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but i think within the target group we have subgroups. we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, and i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. and i dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing so if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull. i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t_v_. they have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable whi which can fit into your hands you you say that won't add too much to the budget? no no no, it won't i don't think it will be like, do you think there's any chance of having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children. so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in in intended for two or three operations, and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. because i think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. you know, like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can develop a tactile sense of it. and display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clockso today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. it takes the power from a battery and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a t_v_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. and so i think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices. yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages it's like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. and different shapes that we can do and of course there should be a case where we can keep all the thingsalright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use, we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep, okay, so, my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. we have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.okay, can can i at this point interject something? we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered. the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_, and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,if we do some more research, maybe we. if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. so now i understand it's lunch break.however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. and what function, working design, how how does it work. now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, and i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. so if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull. i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t_v_. can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? they have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but if we do some more research, maybe we.as user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a a particular programme according to the user choice. and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television. and it should have an it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that. and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t_ in alphabet for more compactability. and i dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thingi take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do i think the marketing manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility. so i'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. because if we're gonna sell this thing, i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present. so it's gotta be really attractive and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the t_v_, the v_c_r_, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.yeah, but but i what i'm very very much doubtful how how far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own problems, issues. so to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, i think.okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.first we going over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less. in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working, our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time?now as an interface designer, i would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like okay. now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. then it should have a next button, then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. now there should be a memory switch. now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. for example, if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, th now the the yeah, the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. so this is one one of the interface which can be created. a very simple interface which has all the t important features. then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons. so you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. yeah, now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use. and this comes with different colours, different shapes. now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function.any comments on her presentation? well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. no, i think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. yeah. this time i'm i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.i have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction. like if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so we have to use some colouring compone compone components. and the second important thing is integrated circuit. which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, this is a normal remote controller. like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled chip. you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors, actually, building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. or we can use solar sells. and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious hard dynamo, a kinetic provision of energy, like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? no, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different,so it should be strong. if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k full a complete chip. like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, which which we used to do before ten ten years before, i think. now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. so i think it's better we go for ordinary buttons.alright, my method is i'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. simple is beautiful. and eye-catching is important.and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. they are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote. i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. this could be one feature which could be sellable. yeah, but but i what i'm very very much doubtful how how far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own problems, issues. so to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, i think. it it's like your recording of all a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.what kind of energy do we foresee? i think i think battery, and i think we all agreed on that. that that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. trendy design, compact and strong. not sure what they mean by supplements. her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. trendy design, compact and strong.i think i think battery, and i think we all agreed on that. that that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing.and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. and the u_i_d_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design, in this phase, the two of you, jana and francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here. you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.in this phase, the two of you, jana and francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here.and the u_i_d_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design,eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget. i just realised one thing. in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty.so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.and then for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent greeni just realised one thing. in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.okay now on the financing we bring up the kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. electronics, simple chip on print? i guess it's double curved. and then we have to interface push buttons. eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget.eight, eight point two. in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.now we have included another feature that is the mute button now we have included the switch on and off button. then we have included one to nine buttons we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, one being good and seven being the worst. yes i think shape is one. and how about on size? i think i would give it at least a two. colour, i gave it a one. one, one, one, okay. and how about the feel? i'll give three. maybe two, and the next is functionality i'll give it a three. it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product.yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty. so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.like before we i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting it should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d d to be integrated in this in this new remote. the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue. she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, should be trendy design, compact and strong,and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. a shell shape.the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubberthis is us in a snail shape so it it is attractive it's blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttonswhat i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, i like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. the colour's very attractive. yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. a shell shape. i think voice recognition is our big selling point i think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance.this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. this is us in a snail shape so it it is attractive bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons it's blue in colour and also compact in shape. the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber now we have included another feature that is the mute button now we have included the switch on and off button. then we have included one to nine buttons we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. and then for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly.and also compact in shape.personally i think i'm pretty happy. and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? i think you've done a good job, miss leader. yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team, yeah. mm-hmm. yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, i think we we did, in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here. so i i thank you all very much.here is what we looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity. is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? we can always improve, yes. so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. if we want to have more features than that. well then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons., are we happy with the creativity that has passed herei mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty. so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.we can do it international,as you can see, we for our remote control, a selling price is twenty five euros. our selling price.our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros,as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. here are some functions. you can save. these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little piece of drawing. a blank new document for each person. select a pen, eraser. then we've got our pen. this pen. it's really funny you can also select the current colour and the line width. and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there. we've got our shared folder, but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder. here is a simple tool bar. it's save, print, move back or forward one page. you can switch between the different drawings. and then we're going to try out the white board. we're going to draw animal. and just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours, and different line width. you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked another thing is you have to be a bit slow. 'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up. we choose form of current colour i think grey is appropriate. now you'll see my drawing capabilities. you have to do it real slow. i was trying to draw a dolphin, and then you can undo maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. gonna use a different line width. maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, i think. you have to go really slow when you're writing. i'm just gonna draw its head, i was gonna draw a cat too, it's prettythis is our agenda. we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing. then i can take some notes maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. but just if you hear something you can write down, just write it down. our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. it has to be original, trendy, and user friendly. project method is there are three phases we are going through. first is functional des design, individual work, meetings. after the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design. the industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design and a bit of the look and feel design. the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design. and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project product ev evaluation. but that will be all worked out in other meetings.and we can all work on our own projects.move along to the project finance. as you can see, we for our remote control, a selling price is twenty five euros. our selling price. our profit aim is fifty million euros. we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well. our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros, just try to remember these points. selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. and production cost maximal twelve and a half euros. that's leads us to our little discussion. does everybody has experiences with remote controls, and i mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones? like you can use for other? no, me neither. kind of broad t_v_ at home, and a d_v_d_ player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the t_v_, one for the video recorder, one for the d_v_d_ player. and i think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. i've i've got one at home. and you can program i think eight different devices in it, i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well. we've we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. and it also operates on infra-red, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. so you have to got the little device inside your room, think it has to be shock proof sure, yeah. my remote control tends to fall a lot. waterproof, thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. how much is left in the battery. but maybe just a little led,waterproof,but they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too.i don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction. we put fashion in electronics, we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. have you all seen the corporate website already? have you seen any flaws in it? i think i found one. but on the corporate information side there's a th there was real remote instead of real reaction.first i will introduce myself. i'm bart, my name's frank. let's start off with a little presentation. now first i'll tell you a little bit about the setting. you can see there are a few cameras here. they'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. is there a project documents folder? there are some notes in it already i see, some documents.i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.think it has to be shock proofuser interface designer the user interface concept, and the trend-watching.what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept,i suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product. 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a t_v_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim. in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. besides that, i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. but i mean if i s if i see this, it's i think we're just gonna go for another standard remote. i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons if we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons. or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now. but don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market, that people think the people think that's the the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it. i think that if we're if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the the elderly mobile phone? if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, i think. we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality. i think teletext can be can be a function as well. but only if if it won't higher the the cost, but deaf people need teletext for for subtitles. i thinki've got a presentation about the working design. first about how it works. everybody knows how a remote works. the user presses a button. the remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v_. the t_v_ switches to the frequency, or what function it is. we've got the the plate. it gots conductive disks for every button. when the user presses a button, a signal got sent, goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_. this is a schematic overview. you've got the buttons. the power source. and when a button gets pressed, its goes to the chip. i think we should use default materials, simple plastics. keep the inner workings simple, i think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product. it's, in my idea, it's it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in in the product itself. so i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements. we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v_. that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it for more functions. another point is we have to skip the teletext, because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past. another one is the customer is forty plus. that's the the market we have to to to target, because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product. so it has to be visible in our design, in the way our device works.because i think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example.we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for t_v_.i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros. n i i don't think so. you got quite a cheap touchscreen. s it's not in colour or something. i don't know if that will rise the cost too much, i think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen,i've been looking at the user interface of it. f for the techno f functions of of it. i think we must use the general functions of the remote control. i i've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one remote control. i've do i've done a little research on the internet and not much information about it, about interface so you've got a lot of devi devices like d_v_d_ television, stereo. but it must be user-friendly. you c you can't put a a lot of functions in one yeah. yeah. in one remote control. you can see, this is quite simple remote control. but this re remote control got a a lot of buttons. what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are. like the on-off button. keep it yeah l like a red button. my personal preferences. use a display for specific functions of the different device. and here you've got a s kind of a display. it's a touchscreen. you got a general f f the functions of the device for a d_v_d_ player or so the pl yeah f for playing reverse. and you got here real buttons for selecting a device. you you never got all the buttons on w one device. we better c use quite large buttons everybody have to use it so ol even even old people young people. we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large. i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros. n i i don't think so. you got quite a cheap touchscreen. s it's not in colour or something. it would certainly make a fancy design. but the it wouldn't be very robust.in different languages, you know. adapt it to different cultures. and with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons. you could i think we n it would be a lot easier tobut it might be a good idea to make a docking station. and this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep. so you'd know where it is in the room. and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred. this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five. this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider.it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it,now we're going into the functional design. then our agenda. first the opening. this time i will take the minutes. you're going to have a presentation. all of you. and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations. so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. my name is freek van ponnen. i'm the market expert. we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls. we let them fill out a questionnaire. in addition we did some market research. see what the market consists of. what ages are involved. these are three quite astonishing results, i thought. seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. in addition remotes were not very functional. fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room. then we did some research to the most relevant functions. channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy. the power button got a nine. and teletext got a six and a half. then there are some one-time use function. that audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons. which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently. one hundred and sixty eight times per hour. sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six. the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market. they are not reallyif we're able to really bring an innovative product. which would explain a button if you press it.it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, few buttons, we talked about that. docking station, l_c_d_. general functionsif we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, i think. because i think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. if we want a with for example the the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people. now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example. but i'd have to look into that a little more.i think it's very important in the in the design. you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places. but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_, you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible. you suggest we could better focus on for example the docking station. i think, mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons but i don't think we should spend very much time in that. do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have? and if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible we're just gonna focus on the extras? i think so.few buttons, we talked about that. docking station, l_c_d_. general functionsmaybe we can implement the scroll button? just look if you look at telephones. the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or but i don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast. and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it. if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout.few buttons, we talked about that. docking station, l_c_d_. general functionsi think teletext can be can be a function as well. but only if if it won't higher the the cost,but do you need the buttons for one to zero. think if you're gonna include teletext you do. maybe we can implement the scroll button? or a joystick like? but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_, you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible.besides that, i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. but i mean if i s if i see this, it's i think we're just gonna go for another standard remote. if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now.but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a t_v_ with internet access 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature within the next like twenty years is very slim. in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. i think teletext can be can be a function as well. but only if if it won't higher the the cost, but deaf people need teletext for for subtitles. i think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. i think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles. is anybody really against teletext?so check out the corporate website maybe. it's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. first i think we can talk about the energy source, f i think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, i think. we could use the basic normal battery. a hand dynamo. there there are four options. but i don't think that's really an option. solar cells. but not every room is very light or the kinetic energy. and how exactly does the kinetic energy work? y you basically shake your remote, and then it powers up. personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product. you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there. it's just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more. i think elderly people just like to have everything in place. and i don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. and also what you said. you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote. but i think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push, and then it starts beeping. and then we can we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the the channels. i'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price? i don't have any information on pricing. we also asked if w they would, if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. you can see here, our target group would not do that. so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote controlso the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.the user interface design, it's the same story. and product evaluation.let me just choose for the battery. but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.but that would also go for the l_c_d_ screen then i guess. it's a bit higher percentage, here the question was, would you prefer it. and on top of that the l_c_d_ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use. and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use. i personally think the l_c_d_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, i think nobody has anything against it. because it's just some extra information, maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.because it's just some extra information, i personally think the l_c_d_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, i think nobody has anything against it.f i think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, i think. personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product. you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there. it's just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more. i think elderly people just like to have everything in place. and i don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. in that case we could use kinetic energy, but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. and much cheaper as well. and that's the best choice. let me just choose for the battery.i suggest the single curved,i'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching i've done over the past few days. we've done some market research. we distributed some more enquetes, questionnaires. and besides that i deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends. most important thing is the fancy design. the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor. innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls. about half of, half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use. for our group, we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old, this is, these factors are slightly more equal. the older people prefer dark colours. they like recognisable shapes, and familiar material. and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people. this leads us to some personal preferences. the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the in the room. so this would mean no eye-catching designs. just keep it simple the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest, because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control. well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be, the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. this is pretty much a new shape to older people. so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station. besides that we would advise to bring two editions, one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel, and one with a grey-black colour. the wood-like for the more exclusive people. people with more money.it's the conceptual design meeting. and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components. conceptual specification of design. and also trend-watching. but first i'll show you the agenda. first the opening. then we have three presentations. after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts. then a little thing about the last meeting. these are the points we agreed on. the requirements and the target market. requirements are teletext, docking station, audio signal, small screen, with some extras that button information. and we are going to use default materials. and we're going to target sixty to to eighty year old customers. i suggest let's get started with the presentations.about the components design. for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, but if we choose for that option, the docking station would c become obsolete. so i don't think it's really an option. for the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing, single or double curved casing. it's really up the the design that we're gonna use. as a case supplement, we could, i thought of that l later, a rubber belt, like a anti-slip. for the b buttons, we can use plastic or rubber. and the chip-set, it says simple here, but it should be advanced, because we're using an l_c_d_ screen. and as the trend-watcher presentation showed, people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines. well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. but depends on what we want. for the case, the supplement and the buttons, it really depends on the designer.some research a about designing of an interface. the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons. that's w what i what i want to to do in our design. just we have just to focus on the primary functions. finding an attractive way to control the remote control. the i found some something about speech recognition. only buttons for sound, for on-off, shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down. we need some new a attractive functions it's like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles. overall user-friendly. using large large buttons. it's possible to to make quite cheap system for speech recognition. you can think about when you lost your remote control, you can call it and it gives an sig signal. and and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound or something, you can just give a sign say sound off television put the sound off put the sound off. i was thinking about the special button for subtitles, just one button to keep it simple. one push on the button you get small subtitles. double push push, if double click, so you get big subtitles, for people which c f who can't read small subtitles. we've got the buttons we have to use. the on-off, sound on-off, sound higher or lower, the numbers, zero to nine. the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel. also we want to use a little d display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons. and we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on. made a little picture of it. just we can put the on-off button over in this corner, d display of it, it's just a small display. you can put it on top. and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel, it's on place where the thumb of of thewood is a lot more expensive to produce. if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey. or both? but i think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive, and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour. but with colour was a lot more expensive? or? i'll have to research. it's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape.is it possible to make changeable case. i think that's a very good option. everybody's okay with the changing covers? i think that's a good good option.so it's gotta be advanced. that brings us to the chip.but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. let me just choose for the battery.if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. so maybe we should just re-focus. just put it on the market for everybody.i think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. i was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers.that brings us to the project evaluation. did we move through the right phases, you think? along the process? think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. in the design phase. so lack of information about prices. the tasks are very structured,if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. so maybe we should just re-focus. just put it on the market for everybody.maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. but we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros. i'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote.is the company company recognisable? yes it is. and they wanna put fashion in their products. in the slogan of the company. and we have the removable front cases.was there room for creativity? not too much. no. it's because of the finance sheet. yeah. yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance and i would've liked to go for the younger users also. and just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions? yeah? teamwork? did it work out? working together? also, you two of you with the last phase?only the docking station, i guess. which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. it's not even taken into the price.i did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. translated it into criteria,, is the remote fancy? the shape, look and feel. innovative? what new functions are there?, easy to use?, learnability is a very important factor here., is it functional? and the cost. the target group. is the remote really for the group we're making it for? i have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. that's because my pen failed to upload his data. is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven? we all go for six?, is the design innovative? i think so, seven? is the design easy to use?. not really. i would say four. four or five between. between four or five. is it functional? yes. do we have too many functions? no. think it's seven. and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? like it getting lost and r_s_i_ influences?, we haven't thought of that one. think we do. are the production costs within the preset limits? they are now. does the design fit the group of focus? i think that's a three. i think with our new radio button, i think it's i think it's better. i still i think it's too m too fancy. too too flashy. i would give it a four. i think i'd go for two. we have the logo there. these are seven factors times seven is forty something. two? forty one out of forty nine. that's around eighty percent. i think that's a pretty nice score.i think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. i think. i think i'm going to make our final presentation now. and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. summary of the project. are we supposed to go into our own rooms again? maybe we have to fill another questionnaire.i will move on to the finance part, and i can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros. i don't know if i've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong. i counted two batteries. but maybe we can also use one. since it rechargeable. that's two euros off. we need the advanced chip. here we have the single curves. we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro., but i think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. then we have the case material supplements. it's plastic. it's the cheapest one we need. but then the biggest costs are the buttons. so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low. let's fir first count the buttons we have now. seventeen. with the help button. i think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long.but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. with only five buttons on it. and a scroll-wheel. holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. i think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. this will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. this is not familiar for them. but they know the scroll-buttons from old radios. they cal also buttons like that for changing channels.this is what me and richard came up with. the default spot for the on-off button. the mute button just below that. then there's the volume and channel selectors. simple plus-minus button. we thought of a help button. if you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the l_c_d_ screen. then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. a button for teletext. a button for the subtitles. and the company logo. so it's rather simple prototype., is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality?, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page., that's just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you came in page one hundred. now you can use the normal one to zero buttons. but you can also use the button th for changing the the channel. s so the shifting button. for yeah shif shifting up in on t on t teletext, and shifting down. so i thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple. just a few buttons and large buttons. but i think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. so i'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. i think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. the on-off button, it's it's a necessity. the volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those. the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume-down button twice. i think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does., or you can build in when you press one button you can't leave out the number buttons i guess. teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary. so it's rather basic already. just n normal plain buttons. but they're supposed to be equal sized, round, with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume, thei still think we should go for the single curve design.but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. i think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. but they know the scroll-buttons from old radios. they cal also buttons like that for changing channels. 'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. this is not familiar for them.i think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long., d i assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? i think so. yeah. with only five buttons on it. and a scroll-wheel. holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. so we make one for the volume, one for the channel. plus scroll. we can leave the teletext in if we want. so we can decrease this one to four buttons.or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d_ display. until you've got the right number, then you push it. that would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. integrated scroll-wheel push-button. but then you you can push some other button as well. yeah. that's right. so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel.in this meeting we will discuss our final design. but first we will do the this is prototype presentation. this is what me and richard came up with.so we make one for the volume, one for the channel. plus scroll. can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button?if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l_c_d_ display. and we can keep our l_c_d_ screen, which can provide extra information. how to use the scroll wheel. how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles.i personally think it has to be multi-purpose. next meeting will start in thirty minutes. you will have individual actions the the the industrial designer has to look at the working design. the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions.now it's time for us to going to discuss a little things. you can think about experience with a remote control yourself, at home. what you think might be a useful new feature. what what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. so not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a d_v_d_ and radio most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. and by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products. maybe some other technology than infrared. i rather find it very annoying, like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you can't switch it. think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. that might be a little bit expensive. and something like an l_c_d_ screen. that, when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the l_c_d_ screen what programmes are coming up or it must be really innovative, technical-wise? you got some cheap remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. but when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special, i think. at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool. but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly and and the price.but our marketing range is, market range is international. so we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our r remotes to.the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro, and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half euro. from my point of view, i don't think it's gonna be very very high tech, high definition, ultra modern kinda remote, for twelve fift twelve and a half euro. the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro. i think w when the selling price is twenty five, you got two million, two million remotes.little little kinda exercise to know each other. at the white board on the left. every every one of us must draw our favourite animal, and tell tell us why we had chosen that animal. important is that we use different colours, and different pen widths. widths. widths. and he's called simba. miniature size? so we found it kinda cool to name it after a lion. it is a turtle. 'cause i liked teenage mutant hero turtles. it's a dog. we had a dog, a few years ago. when it died we didn't get a new one or something. it's the white rabbit from the matrix. yeah, exactly.the tool training. and this is only for drawing. this one is for the presentations, the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you you had. we have two smart boards. and as you may have heard, the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen. not in y the the my documents. this is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen.this is the agenda for today. first a little opening. i will introduce myself, and i think it's very good to introduce yourself. then a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to to to ourselves. that will be done with a tool training from the he these two smart boards. then the project plan. and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. the the the aim is to make a new remote control. first of all it must be original, and trendy. but at the same time user-friendly. there are three stages. there is a functional design. then the conceptual design.my name is danny wolfs. i'm the project manager. i'm juergen toffs. i'm the user interface designer. my name's. i'm the industrial designer. my function is the marketing expert. i'm tim.we must first agree on what we're going to m going to make. i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. that's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. but maybe, because you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we must have a little or kinda consensus on the, what we're gonna do. so you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. i don't know. if the technical functions have to be designed, i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. th that's that's really a step further. we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. and then in the next meeting we decide and then you s then you can delete the o the obsolete details. each individually i individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important. and then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting.i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. so not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a d_v_d_ and radio i personally think it has to be multi-purpose. most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. and by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products.it must be really innovative, technical-wise? you have to do something special, i think. you got some cheap remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. but when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. and by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products.the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions.the the the industrial designer has to look at the working design.we must first agree on what we're going to m going to make. i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. that's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. but maybe, because you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we must have a little or kinda consensus on the, what we're gonna do. so you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. i don't know. if the technical functions have to be designed, i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. th that's that's really a step further. we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. and then in the next meeting we decide and then you s then you can delete the o the obsolete details. each individually i individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important. and then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting.but what i did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup-holder, is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote. if somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes beep beep beep beep or something, maybe maybe something to look into, i dunno what the cost that something like that would be.i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components. the energy source would be a battery, simple battery i figured that would be best, the energy source is connected to the infrared button, but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch when a button is prush pushed in, a electric current goes through here, and in immediately, a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened. that's that's so the h user won't be thinking, well did the button be pressed, w what happened. the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb my personal preferences here, we have to keep it simple. not too many gadgets and functions, i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving. i think we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that, because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, i think current t_v_s can even send infrared. but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control? 'cause that would be i mean extra components, extra designs, larger g remote control. so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. we should look into the design and the functionability. like i said, use one button for instance for m multiple functions, just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something, the usual stuff. we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions, but we we should stick to the basics.i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions. what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design, technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one, so if you going to design a remote that looks good, that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, and another one is the use of many functions will will make it more difficult, so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. and well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen, but s i don't know in how far that is possible, since we are sticking to infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything, but we might consider that. so just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use. i prefer to use it only for t_v_ and and if possible, the buttons should give a dr direct action, not first select you you just said you wanted to to combine more functions in one, and so that's where the difficulties lie. do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original, or multi-purpose as we thought, or do we want to use many buttons. it's maybe an option if you use an l_c_d_ or a touch screen, that in the middle are the the main keys, just in the middle the general functions, like play, channel switching, and then at the top or at the bottom, some menus like settings or that you can drop down. do we want to use a menu display on the t_v_? or does have to f everything be in remotes? 'cause if you use a memory display on the t_v_, you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay. if you use many options in one buttle button, display the menu on the t_v_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the sameit seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff, like an l_c_d_ screen on the remote control, speech recognition. i don't think that's really appropriate., and when you see the audience, the age is going up yeah, they don't really want it anymore, at least the new technologies. second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls. first point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly, and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, following buttons are most important. switching channels, yeah, the second, teletext, and the third, volume controls. but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet. but at the moment teletext is yeah, th the best thing you can get on t_v_, like getting information. they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control.my personal preferences., i think we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five., first of all it's the biggest share, the biggest audience, sixty five percent. second, i think you will get the most revenue from i from it. we have to impro improve the most used functions, as i said here, switching channels, teletext and volume controls. people used to get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us to design ex kind of placeholder on side of the, yeah, of the t_v_ that's a cool idea. when you mentioned improving functions, what what do you mean by that but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control. so you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them, yeah it's so focusing more on the used buttons. but the most used buttons have to be bigger or could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. yeah, perhaps.i'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project. what i did was i dissected current remote controls and i viewed how how they w looked, what kind of components are involved, and after that i put up a scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds. and i'll explain a bit about how it workswhat i did was i i checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared, and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a t_v_ or a stereo or something, and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if we want to build a remote control with bluetooth for instance then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate, so that would mean extra cost for the user so that's probably why most controls are still infrared. furthermore they all have a a very simple structure, 'cause well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote. because well my personal opinion is is not to do bluetooth or or radio waves, what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the t_v_, connected to the t_v_? i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice, but then you'd still have the the infrared function.welcome back. at the functional design meeting i had an email from the from the management board but there were four points which i think are very important. first one is they think that teletext teletext becomes outdated second one is also important the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television, so it not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control, second, and i think that's important for the marketing expert, the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older, but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty. i think to keep in mind, but not really for now is that they want the the the slogan and the and the logo to to be recognised more in the remote.i have some new findings on marketing expert level, the method i used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire. one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results. two audiences, the first one, this scale, from sixteen to forty five age. the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five., as you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five. second audience audience is thirty five percent.you all have the the questionnaire again about the after work.the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email.th th those things are nice. but i think that's we wel later in the stage. and well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v_ it is, but have the opportunity to have more optionsbecause i think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen, and the the the the other functions, the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen, but but if you display it on l_c_d_ screen with r r really big numbers you can display actual buttons on the touch screens. but well we have to look at what's our target audience. w we are aiming for younger people a touch screen, like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications. i th i think we can do that too.so we have now a lunch break, finally, after the lunch break it's back to individual work, once again thirty minutes. i will put my minutes so s they're updated in the shared folder too. the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email. you all have the the questionnaire again about the after work.but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something. especially the important buttons, if you want to switch channel, change your volume, use teletext, it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote, behind a little little thing or a touch screen. i think the idea about touch screen is very good., because recently i saw news item on t_v_ about new telephones for elder people., they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something. make a remote that fits easily in the hands then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? the extra functions. you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions, and you just choose one, wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen, one one small touch screen applet and we have three of those, actually just menus with sub-menus, with or sub-items, sub-functions. then i'd like to make a proposal. if you make one big touch screen, keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. so you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen. that they always make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions, you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v_ or to switch the channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. i had another idea about maybe parental control., like building in some kind of pin code if children don't don't know the pin code, they can't switch to violent channels or is that possible to use or no? that actually dependsokay. so the games are in it. the parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.and, things like teletext, put them in the menu. but, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure.but, the main concept is take one big touch screen., always display the primary buttons clear and visible. and make the menu structure changeable. one thing you've gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. but, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. and, things like teletext, put them in the menu.welcome to the conceptual design meeting, also this time there will be three presentations. and we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts., and at the end, i, when i finish it off i have some input from a master class i visited. information. i will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder.but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic. or you can go for both? i i prefer kinetic because it's well, the costs aren't that much higher, and, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. or but but you could go in a in an double curves. and that's like several different dimensions. yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, i f i figured. yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity. i i ch prefer rubber because it feels yeah.i'll be talking about the components., what i did was i reviewed previously used items by two two different age groups. below forty five and above. senior citizens they, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood and and such more. and they like straightforward shapes. where whereas the young and dynamic, they like a more soft materials., soft and fluffy and colourful and but the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic. or you can go for both? but the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l light., and you you could you could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. i i prefer kinetic because it's well, the costs aren't that much higher, and, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. but, what l what jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. or but but you could go in a in an double curves. and that's like several different dimensions. yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, i f i figured. yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity. i i ch prefer rubber because it feels yeah. well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so i figured i'll just leave it at the l_c_d_., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. i i i would prefer both too. but if you have a square l_c_d_ screen, and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that that covers part of the l_c_d_ screen. that's it's custom customisable and so what are the opinions? rubber or plastic?i have a little problems with my laptop. and s s s so i had a little less time to complete., it didn't work anymore. the entire windowsi went to paris and milan for some trend-watching. in paris and milan, we asked different people, differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend, what they like in design and material nowadays. our main audience, so that's people below forty, prefer the following. at first, the colours of fruit., fresh colours, green, red, strawberry red, yellow, banana yellow. yeah. they like spongy material, okay, our secondary audience, people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. yeah, materials like wood that they have to look fancy., they should be technological in innovative., and easy to use. we have to aim at a mu at the main audience. and, therefore use fresh colours. here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. to customise your own remote control., in my second sheet of personal preferences, we have to reconsider the speech function recognition. you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak speech recognition and stuff., building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users. and third, i stick with it, the log-in functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.i think we can discuss a little about the the three kind of revolutionary things tim came with. i think that parental control is a good function to to put in the remote. how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log-on screen with parents, children. you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. you c may use like when there's x_p_, a simple log-on, d you just push one or two or three. i don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it. well i think that's a b there's a big market for it, just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, i i i if we in incorporate the parental control, let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho child just goes up to the t_v_ and presses up for instance. what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that that you can program with the remote control. okay. and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition? but i don't think when you're watching t_v_, hearing loud noises from the t_v_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, yeah. yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, i think. but okay. so the games are in it. the voice recognition are not. and the parental control are well, i think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control? or are we going to put it in and just i i figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it. well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, youbut, what l what jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. i i i would prefer both too.yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, i think. but the voice recognition are not.we have to aim at a mu at the main audience. and, therefore use fresh colours. here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. to customise your own remote control., in my second sheet of personal preferences, we have to reconsider the speech function recognition. you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak speech recognition and stuff., building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users. and third, i stick with it, the log-in functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.they have to look fancy., they should be technological in innovative., and easy to use.n, next meeting starts in thirty minutes. the the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype. and will drawing it on the smartboard. and, the marketing expert will will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation. but the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email. but i think it was a very very good session, gentlemen. but keep an eye on your laptops for a reali had a i had another idea to put the whole the whole idea of real reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing. when you put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little animation. and with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics. well, if you if you have the l l_c_d_ screen, you can you can have a small logo i at the bottom. that spins around like all the time. it it's just like a globe in internet explorer.i went to a master class and two things are are can come in handy for us. first thing is we talked about knowledge management. knowledge engineering and the fact that that that the idea of knowledge, sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that. it's it's very hot at the moment, so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other what other companies had to also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some yeah. import export.how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log-on screen with parents, children. you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. you c may use like when there's x_p_, a simple log-on, d you just push one or two or three. i don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it. well i think that's a b there's a big market for it, just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, i i i if we in incorporate the parental control, let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho child just goes up to the t_v_ and presses up for instance. what m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that that you can program with the remote control. well, i think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. and the parental control are like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control? or are we going to put it in and just i i figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it. well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, and ten, and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. but you still have the problem about the television itself. you could just blame it on television and make it their problem.the parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so i figured i'll just leave it at the l_c_d_. the buttons will be touch-screen. but there may not be too many buttons.i i i prefer rubber. the case will be double-curved and rubber, in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable.i i i would prefer both too., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. okay. so i think we have decided on the things that from janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.the the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype. and will drawing it on the smartboard. and, the marketing expert will will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.now it's about time to talk about this project. was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? but, that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us. i i didn't think so. that there was a lot of room for it. and i couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. bu well, i th i think you two, especially you and and daniel, you d you you both had the less creative roles in the project. i think jeroen and i, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. how about the leadership? i thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have structure it a l little bit more. so like, i i was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and i was a i was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about the and i think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk yeah, more more consensus. no, it you did better., teamwork? well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. but, really teamwork were you two nah. yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but d just write your name right now. he he knows how it works, yeah. the idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. it's it's not real real use for me. i it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s very slow. be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things, and the eraser was another problem. m abo what kind of new ideas? well, the the idea of the touch-screen is new ideas about the working of this software, about about the project, about the remote controls or i don't know what what i mean. people will still feel thewell, i th i think you two, especially you and and daniel, you d you you both had the less creative roles in the project. i think jeroen and i, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. but, really teamwork were you twoi thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have structure it a l little bit more. so like, i i was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and i was a i was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about the and i think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk yeah, more more consensus. no, it you did better.and and for colours, we we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey. those are the technological colours actually, it would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple, but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one. and young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible, they think, i'll buy for a couple of euros some noi nice hip maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. i think a cover is necessary, so, there must be some cheap standard cover, yeah, but you d you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people. so i think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay that. yeah. yeah, maybe yeah, perhaps you're right., maybe we could develop a cover with wood style. a wood style, a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours. and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. but, the mai i think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours. not too, but w a little,, now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to to the past requirements., we're going to do that with a seven point scale. we have to be consensive about about things. we're going to vote. the remote control is designed for people with age below forty. yeah, it's not just designed for people under the age of forty. it's also designed for people above forty. yeah, two or three, the remote control is beautiful. acco according to us, it's one? or of c of course you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product., the remote control looks fancy. one? the remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons. yeah yeah,, teletext buttons and volume buttons? teletext is in the menu. volume is true. yeah, the they are big and clear.. i would give it a more a five or a six. the remote control is easy to be found. well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. if you put your normal remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable? it'll make a difference. well, we p we can do it glow in the dark. because four is between three and also between between true and false., w according to the the other remote controls, there may be there in your t_v_ room, this one will stand out, i think. if this lying on your couch, you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange thing. if your fifteen remotes in a drawer, you find it, yeah? but but the survey under users was that they really lost it. yeah, that's stupid. most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. i would call choose two, 'cause we decided not to make two f fresh colours, as it would not. yeah, yeah, not too flashy. the remote control is made of soft material. yeah, rubber, is kind of soft. yeah, but notokay, we have now to c to calculate the production cost. yeah, if the costs are under twelve and a half euro, then we can ra move on to the project evaluation, as we have experienced it. otherwise, we have do have to do a little redesign thingy. so kinetic, one. battery, yes. one. advanced chip. so it's only once double-curved. we're now in a problem, 'cause we have reached eleven euro yet. then we'll see we'll we'll see wha how much we are over budget. special is the special colour? yeah, but we want to make the wood colours, that no, this is a standard colour. yes, this is a special colour. yeah, if if you're honest, we'll type one, special colour. yeah, but but d but daniel, tha that's that's another brand. that's another article well, we're only four euro over budget.well, we're only four euro over budget. well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved., single-curves. the kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. what do you think about putting a battery in it, but also selling like the covers, a docking station but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then no, it's it's just one curve and not a back curved i think. or but it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. no advanced chip, that's a little bit of problem. so, if we do this, we're on twelve and a half euro., there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. if you make it double-curved, it costs one euro more. but i don't know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price. yeah, well let's assume it is. but i i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. no, well, y i mean, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k remote control is kinetic. yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. so because if you want to go to kinetic, you're you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and i think now it's it's more of a compromise well, we were above, so we did a little redesign, once again i'm gonna take minutes., first we have a prototype presentation by g_ and g_. evaluation crit criteria., in combination with the finance i i received a an an excel file which we have to fill in later on., and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half euro. and after that, an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the smartboard, with the with our laptops, with the all all this. once again, forty minutes,nah. yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but d just write your name right now. he he knows how it works, yeah. the idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. it's it's not real real use for me. i it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s very slow. be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things,i would g give the word to g_ and g_ for the prototype presentation. shall i give a short introduction and then yeah, well sure., this was our first concept. we decided to use a single touch-screen. and, well, we began with with a form of shape, that is is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed. well, during the meeting i showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand, yeah, well, and as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel l_c_d_ screen. well, these would be the main buttons, h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to. we have the more advanced menu setting right here. we have the sub-menus and stu stuff. as you can see, this there, there are two weird bumps in it. this is for the added effect of well y youth and dynamic. and so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down. the s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers, but the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and stuff. you can make a more thinner design, so, you have room here for your battery s and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip., you can see there's a v a very youthful dynamic exterior. it's like an easter egg. yeah, it's like an e but this is for children. we we want a more adult version. so this actually basic the idea. we we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of of this.because there must be some kind of end report. about all the meetings, what we have decided, here is standing whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. maybe we can do it together. so i i s i will put it on a story-board., this is about the functional design, but you can save it u the under another name. it's a read-only version. about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control., it must be simple to use, very clear what to do, and at the younger people. no, you have to put, switch channels at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second a volume changing, second. s switch, yes. then the conceptual design. well, okay, maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost., he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. it's not double. nay but that this is what was initial, the plan. the initial plan. and the the added functions like tetris snake, the added functions., was it included in the cost? i don't think so,? okay, so anybody misses something here about yeah, the end conclusion. that's that's what i'm gonna write b between now. yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the conclusion, i think. well i gonna redesign something now. oh, before you change anything maybe you save it first. finish meeting now. i'm going to finish my end report.that's that's what i'm gonna write b between now. i'm going to finish my end report.and lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. but, the mai i think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours. so i think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay that., single-curves. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved.the kinetic thing, can

it's it's just one curve and not a back curved i think. or but it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. no advanced chip, that's a little bit of problem. if you make it double-curved, it costs one euro more., there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. but i don't know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price. yeah, well let's assume it is. but i i

       "\"my name's adam duguid, ebenezer ademesoye. i'm the marketing expert. tarik rahman. t_a_r_i_k_. industrial designer., dave cochrane. and you're going to be the user interface,this is the agenda for today's meeting. as you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, the very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. we're gonna have the three kay phases, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? here we have an elephant. tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry?, here we have a tiger. dave, if you'd like to have a dash., the monkey,. but cats are one of my favourite animals,project finance. as you can see, twelve point five euros per unit. and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. that was profiting,do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? like control pads, you know of games, and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well.any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? one thing i'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes that can be programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, b it occurs to me there might be a niche for for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. and therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket. with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive, but you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros. would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the t_v_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the right channel as well, i've noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, i've seen the bar-code design before, instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, keypad, for playing games. i think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot., you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, that'll bebut you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the t_v_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the right channel as well,so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality,, how the user interface might work,project finance. as you can see, twelve point five euros per unit.and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five.mm-hmm. the other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form,one thing i'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our absolutely prohibitive,we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,the other option of course is that the the clapping one. digital telephones, for example, one unit has somewhere where there's a button, of course you have to have that base unit, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t_v_. something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. again say what, it would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario i would say, so that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the t_v_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an l_e_d_, we could just incorporate it anyway.do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_. should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? we could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? actually i would say maybe two two function buttons, the y we're now using the menus button and and an og and an okay button. i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? yeah, think so. so that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the t_v_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an l_e_d_, we could just incorporate it anyway. you could go for quite an interesting design. something that can make it stand out slightly. i should just look at the speaker, the speaker and an l_e_d_.we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there.i mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid, would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? i would say so, yes, i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now.remote control should only be used for the t_v_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues.i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_.teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet.i'm responsible for working design,, this is basically the inside going on of the the remote control. so we have the energy source, we have the user interface, the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, do we need many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that,, there'd be more components to deal with that. you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, you have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, will contact the t_v_ do we need on the control different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs,, i dunno what we should decide on that.i i was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? we could use say the left and right for changing channels and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay.this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote. the presentation is already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices i've looked at looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. on the one hand and this this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. and on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. but the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what what a given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most. something that's something that is more programmable, that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha orbut if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen i think probably for the first couple of hours of using itbut i think we don't have a specific audience, like what is our target audience, i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile., if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose. maybe then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers, rather than the public. however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, it's just, the way i figure it, twelve point five euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that,, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television.i hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice activated control. however i've got a couple of worries about that. the power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l_c_d_ which has been kind of put forward so far, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels i i was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white. si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined. we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sortwe'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the t_v_ a bit more, mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, and ergonomics of the remote control as well. it's come to my attention the following. teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. remote control should only be used for the t_v_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues. also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. just to say quickly i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so. i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first,finally, my opinion. the voice recognition thing is cool. and voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. it's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. i'm pretty sure people would buy it. i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, so if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that however, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. but if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. there're two options. either you have voice recognition by itself, which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control,, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a whilefunctional requirement by me ebenezer. we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. we asked some open ended questions, and we asked some very specific questions, please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. takes too long to master the remote control. i've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, some of the good stuff we got. between the age of fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different,however, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, so if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that i'm pretty sure people would buy it. for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. and voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. the voice recognition thing is cool. but for a very fixed number of words, it's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, i mean most people use a remote control

control. however i've got a couple of worries about that. the power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voicedo we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? yeah, think so.and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay?we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, l_c_d_,say something like lithium ion battery,product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. you're gonna look at product evaluation.you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay.seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, having the use of the l_c_d_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components,, say something like lithium ion battery, looks like we going for a double curved design. i don't know what cost implications there are in that., looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. there would be basically two points of articulation. w one below and one above the m the the main sort of grip. do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? but it could be a weak point in the structure, do you think? if you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? sure, yeah. make it harder to lose, as well. the noise for when you lose the banana, f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. y you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the t_v_ responds to. but if weprogramming them can be a right pain. so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer and you could download programs for it from for t_v_s from all sort of main manufacturers. i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the t_v_ responds to. but if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_ programming it to use your t_v_, you might hook it up to the p_c_. the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming i'm not sure, but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u_s_b_ might be prohibitive.like i said before i i think we should have the r_r_ on the on the top function button. so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used.., looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber.looks like we going for a double curved design.if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? sure, yeah.we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. and then we we research fashion trends in europe, we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. as in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, technology technical technologically innovative. people want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. like the interface is really important. and easy to use, it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. the fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. how that relates to a remote control i don't know. spongy. if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then can i skip the rest? the rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. kinda spongy material. we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future now the fruit and veg options, either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. few questions about a spongy remote control. i've never seen one before. if we want something strong and sturdy, i say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, i just don't know how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonnai was given a an h_t_m_l_ file giving various ideas from from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. i wasn't very impressed by them nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. rather than looking at other remotes, ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. and what we've basically decided on was the the the joy the joystick, two function buttons and the l_c_d_, i don't actually think we need the the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available v via via the l_c_d_ is one where you scroll through channels, you must have two two modes, basic mode, where the joystick's left right left right for channels, up down for volume, and the and the menu mode for further functions. now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. and also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the the you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, you know, soft to touch the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the f of the four finger and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users. and you then have, at the at the bottom, the l_c_d_, and this would need to be articulated as well. the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. and then thethis meeting is the conceptual design phase and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of,, the case le that's what i wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic. but later on we found out that it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. we decide what it's gonna be. probably plastic. we need the infra-red transmitter. joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it, could be plastic w or rubber even as well. three different types of batteries. can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else a solar powered one. the bat the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? and solar cells, i dunno about that.. we should probably just use conventional batteries., just like in usual remote controls.. and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? double curved. it probably means this is probably double curved. whereas a single curved would be like that. it looks better than the single curve, but you can't have it in titanium, and for the buttons, it can have the scroll wheel but it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use l_c_d_ it's even more expensive. there's trade-offs there. you have to decide, if you have a double curve control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. i reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l_c_d_, does that in shoot the costi think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say the requirements that we've set out. those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick, l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck.quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation.. we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them? people made good use of the pen and paper? i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this. though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves. how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? good. yeah i liked it, leadership. as much as can be leadered in this thing. very good. last one we've got is room for creativity. unti until until accounts came along, we're burs bursting with creativity. we we're not lacking in ideas, i think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. i think we needed a larger budget.. i mean i th i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in i i think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and such. maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more yeah, to begin with. it is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, before i quickly write up a final report. but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff.we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. so five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. which gives us an average of three. it's it's not bad. considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good?we've got the use of the l_c_d_. i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ displayas for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, because it's gonna be flat on one side, i've said single curved. so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l_c_d_ display. other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first, and show us the prototype. quite how the best way to do this is, i'm not sure, i think if we both step up and outline our ideas. do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the l_e_d_. as it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round, but as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand, the l_ the l_c_d_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design. this design could be done with with plastic casing. though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. i i got your note about keeping the cost down. as for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, really the curve that's most needed is the underside and you have thethis design could be done with with plastic casing. is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, plastic for some reason incurs no cost,l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow,slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, or what we did was that we we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we've got point two of a euro left over there. even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate. it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now.. we've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the l_c_d_. i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the l_c_d_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. mm-hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular do you have any data on how much different prints cost? i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design? you now have as much information as i do.. i've said single curved. we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, if i've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button. as you can see, the use of an l_c_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well i'm very much open to suggestions of wherebasic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. it's a seven s seven seven step kinda evaluation process. seven scale. after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those i put together from the user requirements phase. those are the criteria. and perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points. we have to go through each point. and just give it a a score. how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. i mean, is the homing thing still the locator, is that still yeah, that's still part of the design. i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost,. and making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing, on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? i'd say number one. just before we go through all of the steps here, well what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. something i neglected from my initial research that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. and this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? i guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, and we can come back to it, you said. slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budgetability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. three. i think we can do three. reduce the number of unused buttons. i'd say we're doing well there. easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus we're not doing so badly. easy to use let's forget that one. fancy looking. it doesn't get much fancier. technologically innovative. we're getting rid of the locator thing. i'd give it a three for this for that. i mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on on a remote, materials that people find pleasing. sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. plastic, it sucks. mm-hmm. i'd s i i'd give it a six, to be honest. that's totally thrown everything off balance. inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours. we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype leopard print would be cool. but by this i think it's more a case of fruit and veg, it would also help keep the the product placement is this like a banana type colour? it's not shaped like a banana is i i think s i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie.. i mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg,. i'd i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. yeah, i'll go with five.we'll come back to your evaluation just to give you an idea, you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well,most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, we've got the use of the l_c_d_.. i think if we remove the the l_c_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings if we remove the l_c_ display, we could save ourselves i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l_c_ displaywas that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs or what we did was that we we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_, which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we've got point two of a euro left over there. even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate. it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now.. i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, if i've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, this one comes in under price as you can see, what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? have we factored that in? no, we haven't, not that's too expensive if we remove the l_c_ display, we could save ourselves i mean ho how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the the articulation? i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved,changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved, could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.the industrial designer, is going to be looking more into the working design.and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to yourthe industrial designer, is going to be looking more into the working design. user interface designer. i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w so technical function. what is technical functions exactl what effect should the thing ha should it have, and the m_e_, what does that stand for? m marketing, right.. so we'll be working on the user requirements,, i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t_v_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. what if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? hand-sized.i also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons, but like, i don't know you, just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like, no, you never use half of them. so. but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. so you can programme like your favourite channels, but, would you have the screen on the thing, or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen. so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, i mean, we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device.our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro., and we will hope to sell this internationally. how many should we sell then? well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty, that'll do four million.user interface designer. i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w so technical function.experience with remote control., i think one thing is that it should be easy to find i mean you always know where your t_v_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. what if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? hand-sized. i also think

other thing you said that thing about robust and water water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to yourso we'll be working on the user requirements, marketing, right..so f here's our agenda for today. we're gonna do some tool training, project plan and discuss then close. so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. right. functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things.so we're gonna try out our white board. so you want us to draw it and then talk about it? or just draw it? i think both. we ought to decide who starts and all that., i'm abigail claflin. and i guess we should all get acquainted. so this is our kick off meeting. hi i'm chiara, i'm the marketing expert. i'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer. i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer.and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in., teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list., also our remote should be used only for television,, and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this,so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? it's easy to implement. but i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme, if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. and i was thinking, i_r_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work, so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. yeah, so it would be a two part package. do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall we probably leave that. so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range, you don't need a light. and like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so then it can live anywhere. like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's'cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities. and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type, that's the the technology these days., how do i put this so what happens it doesn't work? could you just plug it back into hers the cable might be a little loose or something. okay so now i need to press f_ eight, what is it? what's function?i think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know, like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the t_v_. so we definitely want a power button and numbers. that sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah. but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then? you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like w right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down. like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just so but i'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you're if you're on t_v_, like you can switch channels, but then if if you're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracksin order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, i don't know what r_s_i_ means. so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. the other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. and if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and, most likely,and i think we should design according to these buttons.this my presentation about the technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. and okay so basically i think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way, keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum, but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the t_v_. or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_? i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour and you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote, so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_. and also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t_v_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, processor to take the information, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be, battery for the energy source, a button pad for input, i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_, and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself.so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall we probably leave that.like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's then it can live anywhere.you don't need a light. and like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, soyou know actually our our new project requirements, i'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things. so i'll i'll check that and update you on the nextso everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire,then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.it's easy to implement. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. yeah, so it would be a two part package.if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.so we definitely want a power button and numbers.like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just that sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.but the only thing is like, ipods are so expensive, i don't think it's the wheel dealy. so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire, then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kindaand you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation.you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits., i'll just review what we did in our last meeting., under marketing we targeted our audience,, then we considered some design options with how it should look,, can i do next? 'cause i have to say something about the material and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion, fancy look and feel.. next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. and th last thing is the easy to use factor., our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend so we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. and also go for a spongy feel, i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go.. i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?, our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend so we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. and also go for a spongy feel, i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go.. i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?i think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo, oh, a dynamo is, it's a bicycle. it's a bicycle mechanism. yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. so i sort of picked battery. no. but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own. so if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f i find them annoying. but we need to find cost. like the chip is probably the most expensive part.so i've been looking at the components design., so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard., i assume we'll be custom designing our case, and we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board,, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, the ipod-style wheel. and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote., i'd recommend against titanium, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case., well we can use wood. i don't know why we'd want to., and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design., we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip.oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough.i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out,i mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes, i mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. like, i think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir i'm f i'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. w when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top i think, if you held it like that. what if,, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingif you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingand then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, so i guess we have to look into the,, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's oh how they make the menu show up on the t_v_? i believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t_v_, not inside the remote.oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there.we're gonna try to talk about, what kind of how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. and,, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system., so people are going to be looking at this little screen. i mean i assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. but the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on. i mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ yeah, well we don't want the screen i guess,but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thingi mean i assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. but the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if and then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. yeah, well we don't want the screen i guess,you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits. and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing so where are the fruit and vegetables now? i guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.but we need to find cost. does anyone have costs on the on the web? all it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. it didn't give me any actual cost.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,okay we have to fill in all this stuff. so i guess we're supposed to write final reports.so i guess we're supposed to write final reports. all of us? i don't know... or is that just me?and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft, powerpoint or any of this stuff. but l but i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, i don't really think i dunno what i'm doing here. and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations, my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff yeah well mine was mostly made up but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a wholethe prototype making was very creatively stimulating it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. yeah, i thought we all worked very well together.i guess we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of i felt like i was off-task all the time. what do you guys think of the pens? they're kinda hard to write with though.but l but i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, i don't really think i dunno what i'm doing here. and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations, my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff yeah well mine was mostly made up but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a wholeso our design looks something like this. this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever. and the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. so you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. you could change the vegetable, or fruit. it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out. it's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable,last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft, powerpoint or any of this stuff.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,and i think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. 'cause i mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. we could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. and you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. we could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. and you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, i have to say,i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. well the worst ones were three point one. material technologically innovative, batteries easy to insert for some reason, i think that's not a problem any more. you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, it might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.and the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. we can do it separately and then discuss it we'll just go in a circle. okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? so it's a one was true and seven was false? oh i thought it was the other way round. i thought it was the other way round too.right what happens is we have to decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start. and we we have therefore in total we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. true is one and and false is seven. i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. apparently i'm supposed to use the whiteboard. is it necessary? i don't think so. we'll just go in a circle. okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? i'm i'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone.if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an excel spreadsheet. the only one that's in there, production costs. but if i missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed i said uncurved or flat. my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. there's plastic for that area around the button. and lots of special colours actually. okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.well the locator is just chip that's inside there. and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, and we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the the project initiation. first of all i want to ask mister ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and well i think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. we'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. but do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or for the moment not yet. do you have some project plan, something with you or this is like i said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. so by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan, okay, certainly by the next meeting. so there's any questions or first of all about this project?good morning everybody here. and i want to introduce myself, my name is shrida daseri and i'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. so i want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here. my name is agnes and i'm an user usability user interface designer. my name is ed and i do accounting. do you also do marketing? so only accounting? and i'm christine, and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer. so who is marketing, nobody in the market marketing is, is me.yes, so what i prefer maybe you need to interact more with the christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, so, what i prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the christine more and within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do the your sales plan, okay, do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up that's up to us to decide,? yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is you both of the christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. then we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. okay, so i think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. okay, and if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. or maybe, you are my coordinator, am i right? i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look atwould you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? yes, i will. yes.well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. it should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition, th i agree it has to be something it has to be something new, whether it works or not, they have to first say i like this, i like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use.and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that.christine, what about your the industrial design plan? are you have a design already on this product or you're still working on the design? no, i i have not begun working on the design, i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and i understood that that was the project goal. i just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, so you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? well, i would th think that depends on how much money you give us. because, you know, you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models. yeah, but before we talk about the finance, okay, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also. i kind of think that in general you have to do y you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal, and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own. so it would really would need to you know, i don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. but when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? well, i've got a lot of other projects i'm doing right now if they go quickly then it could be a month. if if i run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. so like what's your functional design, what's your technical design, and how many people you need for this project, and what's the time frame you're looking, okay, and what is the budget, maybewhat is the goal of the project? the goal of the project i think maybe i'll hand out to the ed, okay, so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. so can you explain what exactly the product is? from what i had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, oh i think, if i'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. 'cause i had two different things. i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. so we're have to design something that is very user friendly. something visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product, because i think everybody's experienced with remote controls, we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use, 'cause a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed, okay, and how it's going to be work,well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, no, i i have not begun working on the design, i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and i understood that that was the project goal. i just did s see that we were starting a new project togetherso, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, orokay, so i think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay.so, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about further things. would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? yes, i will. yes. and if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me, or just send me email, or just come and knock my door, okay,so then we can discuss about further things.from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to to give an idea what the management is looking for, i was looking for a a remote control to have a s i have a sales price of twenty-five euro, with a production price of twelve and a half euro. for what i think from what we're trying to find, we're tr we're looking for, i don't think that price is exactly in the market. in the recent surveys, from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. twenty-five euros, that's that's a preson reasonable price. now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, then it w it could possibly sell. but, i think there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. and we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. louder, softer, on, off. thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. so we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly. fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. so maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep, but, in the cost that the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. but if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's very easy easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like i said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, so we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial design. but, price obviously we have to talk about. what do you think about the design, what he was talkingwhat i can suggest to you, christine, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, i can recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_, because they're already in this speech recognition part, and if you want, i can coordinate, okay, to get some information, and you can let me know, okay, so what kind of the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from what today.from from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. what do they want?, a risk, take a risk on the market? something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily s make a boom in the market? because it has to be something totally different, but end of the day, you're the sales guy, it's of course it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us i don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of the management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, they want something new, i think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, and i hope i can convince the management on that,the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. so, in our case, existing remote controls. we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, and then what the remote control should look like, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off. you need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever. the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. the buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. so, i would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons. so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placedshould we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? i mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? i mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting,and it will be slim, 'cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like i said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. so maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep,it says individual actions, and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. supposed to work on the user interface concept, so i'm supposed to do the components concept, and eliminate them later in the process,from from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. what do they want? the management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, i think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, and i hope i can convince the management on that,and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.supposed to work on the user interface concept,and eliminate them later in the process, i think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.and if you want, i can coordinate, okay, to get some information, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, i can recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_,so i'm supposed to do the components concept,management come with the new proposal, and i have to discuss a few points on this. both says new insights in the aim of your project. the one is the teletext becomes outmoded, okay because if because of the computer systems and the new technology. we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. and the second one is about the remote control. should be used only for the t_v_. and the third point, it's very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product.i'll invite christine to discuss about the functional design. i i figured we should identify some user requirements, and from my experience, i wanna, and from research i did, the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those, and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction, especially in the the the outside of the product i did a little history on the the remote controls all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which i think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind. you could throw it at things if if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. but i just took some different schematics and i guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. personal preferences, i i'm really thinking outside the box here, and i think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. so something that's very very flexible and inflatable i think it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and kind of blend in with things, i think it needs to be waterproof, because sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, i keep pushing on the remote control, and i don't know if it's actually understood my message, so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. and, course i never wanna replace the batteryif you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. because especially today, you know, you have the family and the kids, and the kids throw it if you can add the feature, okay, for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, i dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. titanium would be be heavy, too, i wanted feedback, but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts. i like titanium. expensive. it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though.do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it. then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. an and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay.maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. an and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay. so, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay, then, then we can proceed from there.maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. so, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay,you know, maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like a b some sort of a foam rubber ball, and then they would squeeze it, and it would take the shape of their hand. but th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. it was nokia that came out with this changeable colours. right, you take it apart, and put on another face, take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions, millions. we'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna learn about labour laws. you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap, but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries. so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, india we're here to design, come up with a nice product. but that that we can that we can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the the quantity, okay. so we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something, but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay,and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so i mean i think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be so, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you. i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it. what we'll do is,, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until th ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display.why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood.i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? do you wanna take an action item to go find out?so, it's a very short presentation, 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board i took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume and channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded, so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control. so, that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability., one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. and also you had issues with the batteries running out, so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. and in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses and, like you said, speech recognition. you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself, so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels and volume, sort of for surfing channels and then volume, so the volume would be the up and down, 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels lefti mean i think it's a good idea, so, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you wanna take an action item to go find out? once we get a price on it then we can market it.i also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. i also have copied a different type of remote. we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today, 'cause trends change very very quickly. looking for next generation of innovation, fancy and feel-good, that's what we've been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that's easy to use. easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that, and i think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. the second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. the second one, there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use. the first one, i see that they put in a display. now there's something else with the little flip-up, now we're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip-up, if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. maybe the display also makes it easier to use, so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours context-sensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ or something else is in. especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition andwe'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, india but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries.we were looking he specifically at the components the following components, the case, the power supply, the means of communications with the television set. in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition, you have to have microphone well no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device, it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record, what's worked, what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because, course, we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us, so for the case, we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. course, you know, i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it's goes with the board. and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, so we still had titanium and and wood available, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium, so then there's this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board, these simple chips, but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one. and then there was the regular which i regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one. the other option wasbut le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay, a customisable and and i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. so the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determinednevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood. i i'd really think we should, you know, use some of some really exotic woods, like, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. i think that people will might really want to design their own cases, and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have have it be made out of wood. why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? because it gets brittle, cracks we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. i think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, i mean it chips, it if you drop it, so so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. i think if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that,i think that people will might really want to design their own cases, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. so the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determined and i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. a customisable and i think they could be rubber like they are now, what about the buttons, would would the buttons be wood too, ori would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. you can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. in fact, we should sell through amazon, or ebay, yeah. that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, and you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. the weight and feel. but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit. i don't think that's not possible,well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. let's proceed with this model, okay, for the for the marketing direction, okay. so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. so we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the second generation. the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. no, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped, when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. so, you're right, timing is very important,ed, d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t_v_ remote control sales? would it be the christmas season by any chance? the sports time. sports season. right before the eur the world cup. world soccer. world cup soccer, yeah, that's a good idea. but, so, i'm just ig pointing out a a strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at a a major sports event that's actually good place to advertise it too. there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it, maybe some management has got relationships there we can leverage. yes, the that of course i will convince the management to do that, okay.so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.and we've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it's too expensive, well then you just take it off. this is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. so if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display. s and it's one of those very light, very touchable displays. additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front.so then let's come to the finance, i have some calculations which i made as for the budget. so here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells. it's optional, somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print, that's what we were talking about that. so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker, then we have the wood material, then special colour and push button. actually, our budget was twelve point five euro, but it's coming to nine point nine five euro, so we are under below the budget, well we haven't come to mine yet, so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion, yes.. it's gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it? on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a l_c_ display. l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive, no we do, but it's not filled in. we don't have the price up there, you're right, sorry, yes. okay, so if we add approximately two to three euro per remote, now we're up around about twelve, twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested. so that means we can put the the l_c_d_ in, yeah. but as far as production i'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. so when it go into the quantity, okay, and the cost will come down. although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on on-order basis, it might be the the quantity won't m won't it'sso what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions, whatever, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount. if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five euro, with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. at two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit. i just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these. now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. but being that the market changes very very quickly, maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. so, now we have to come up with a decision. can the company sell two million units? can it sell it for fifty euros?yes, the that of course i will convince the management to do that, okay.and let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is overokay, let's talk about maybe first for the prototype. i've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done, so if i'm missing anything, christine can just correct me. from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, the yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. you have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. the green are the channel changing. and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom, and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_, and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. the material that we chose was wood, and the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. we haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. that depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left i think the microphone is on on the top, on the middle, the under the flip. but it shouldn't be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice. my opinion i think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, okay, so then you can speak then you can close it. but if you put it on the on the flip, okay, then technical i don't think it's feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, i can just use my voice. i mean it doesn't have to be onokay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value.it can be on the side somewhere. yeah, the sides maybe is good.so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.in fact, we should sell through amazon, or ebay, yeah. so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. that's actually good place to advertise it too. there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it,so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. so we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time andokay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real. we probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it.this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. it's gonna be very hard to reduce. so what i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, i will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down. at two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit.well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. so no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. no, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time andfirst we have three steps of making the the remote control. fir the first thing is th the functional design, we have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, the the second thing is the conceptual design, that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. and we have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market. and the third thing is the detailed design it's exactly how it looks and whatever.these are two smartboards, with the f s an introduction of that one. and you already saw you know all that that you here can put things in the the red project map. what we're going to do first is you have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. and and say why it's your favourite animal. first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. use pen format. and a different colour can use here line width ten. just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. it's a very nice elephant, you can see. it's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying. and then what's the colour? how do i do it's in format. just make a new blank new blank page. maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, let's make it a dog. i make a cat of it. i just draw too quick i think. i thought these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to word, but you actually got to write on the paper. but i d i i thought it would be just in in in typed words in word, but it's just a picture. y you can you can't edit in the edit it in word. it's not that cool as i th thought it would be. now we just have to save everything,hello. hello. you all read what we are going to do or not? we're gonna make a remote control. i just made a a simple presentation. that's my name,. we're going to make a remote control, are we going to this agenda of our meeting. you know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. it has to be original, trendy, user-friendlymy laptop is crashing. actually my laptop doesn't work, okay. i think it works. how does this work? press f_ eleven. just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. it's a bit slow you can see, how do i doyeah, it probably would be universal. i don't think you can buy a a a universal remote control for twenty five euros, i know you can buy a re a universal control for only twenty euros we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ player so a lot of buttons on the remote control.what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, we can try to make it special. if we control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it it has to be clear, and how big should it be? it shouldn't be too big, but i don't think we can make it too small, we can't make it smaller than the things we see now i think. or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. maybe more trendy. fold open, where you can see more options. i think something on top, just dren general things like volume and t_v_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. o or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? or maybe to keep it easy and small. but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. and we have to care for the strength of the remote control, because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken. and if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. you can put games on your remote control. whatever.ma maybe a home station. should you put it in a recharger but yeah, we have to look at the price now i think. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, the option, just the option, that's cool.what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros. and we have to make a profit of fifty million euros, so we have to use a big market in europe. the production cost are about half the price of selling price, can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million,for m for me the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do i need to think as a user, what's in the market, i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_, a d_v_d_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.we're gonna have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? that's a good question. because we sell it lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it apart.yeah, it probably would be universal. we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ playerwe have to close this to finish this meeting, for m for me the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do i need to think as a user, what's in the market, i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_, a d_v_d_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.and how about the batteries? should you put it in a recharger ma maybe a home station. but yeah, we have to look at the price now i think. how much is your standards mobile phone recharger? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive, but i don't know what the project projection costs are for such a thing. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, because lots of people are lose their remote control and don't know where it is, maybe use it as a separate option. sell it separately. and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station, or you can change your batteries, the option, just the option, that's cool.i i set something on paper already, size, looks, usable, the buttons on usable places, the the on off button must be on top, it has to lay good in the hand, does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works. you can have the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume obviously on t on top, so you can see. so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. but the rest is you don't use that often, and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, on on top are the the basic options on top, basically when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or so, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. so maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. just think about it.we can try to make it special. or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. where you can see more options. i think o or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. and if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. so maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. just think about it.so we just can skip the l_c_d_ r on the remote control, i i think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, yeah, i tho i think that's not usable. i don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. okay, no speech recognition.we can make the normal one also a normal light. not a led light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. yeah, i think so. if you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, it's the same as the telephone. yeah.we definitely should use it. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. i use te teletext every day, i think. we just keep it one level then?i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a t_v_ remote control only. it still has to be f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. all these points we have to look at. the the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people. so we have to look at that as well. 'specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, so make it just a different colour or different shape,and the the forty plus people, i already told you. oh, this is a problem. oh sorry about that. the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. so it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's it changes things. that kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. but younger people i think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext.i've used a marketing report on the site. i think you've read it too. and f and furthermore i surfed the o the other site. i didn't get it anyway. i i was the only one who get it. it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users. and they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof. i i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of a lot of findings. seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. so we have to make a beautiful remote control. eighty percent of users would spend when a remote control will l look fancy. older people will spend more money for something what's good. because younger people are more critical about where they spend their money money at. seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. i think we we have to make good zap buttons. the last point is quite an interesting fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. and maybe our fold open system is is a good one, we should have the ten percent on the on the top, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. that's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to recharge the batteries or something. i thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. you must find it quickly.. maybe just a button on the home station. so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station. we can combine that. it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. i think we must t take a look at this. it's only th thirty four of the thirty four percent. but it's a tough one. next, remote controls are bad for r_s_i_. because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we we c this is sothat's not very good, because i thought about television, d_v_d_ player, stereo and v_c_r_. but it's already out of the question, this. my point is, well, i if we ma make a a remote control for only television, i think it's hard to sell it for twenty five euros.we have a new age of forty plus. but y but you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients? so we just can skip the l_c_d_ r on the remote control, i i think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for twenty five euros.technical functions design. but we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. not too full, like jens already said, only ten percent is being used. what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or but yes basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. a way to find out what people use is maybe just to use questionnaires on the internet of functions i could think of. volume, channels, the the basic according to. just one two three etcetera. text service options. basic on-off. play, pause. i dunno if that's usable miss did i miss any other buttons, basic buttons? that's the only th the only thing you need. the p next and previous. li like a web browser, six seven eight or five. but there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before. like a web browser back button. but i think it's all too difficult for old people. just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time. i think f especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. yeah, the ten plus button. just one one pressing, or quickly after each other. w wouldn't it be a problem to because you h have to be fast enough. but i think that's in the t_v_ as well. that's how the the t_v_ t_v_ handles it. so you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons. it's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. so if you have a universal t_v_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu. so you also need a menu button. and then navigation but we can integrate that with volumeit's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. so if you have a universal t_v_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. so we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. so that it can be used with all the t_v_s. we have to really understand what patterns are used, otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to an automatically search function for each television, or something. i dunno how it's exactly how it works. i i use a universal remote control, and you have to put in a number, i have a modern one. and the modern one you you you type search, and after a short time the television turns off. and then you know, oh it it's the right one.l_c_d_ doesn't work for twelve and a half euros i think. and i d i don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control, i i don't y you'll use it often, because you can see on the television wh what channel you i think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. because the like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good i think. but some of you had something to read about speech recognition. yeah, i tho i think that's not usable. that's very that's fancy. that's cool. only the numbers, only numbers. furthermore nothing. but only the numbers, one to twenty or something. yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well. if it's possible. i don't think it's very expensive actually. i didn't have information about that. and and and does it have to work only in english, or in dutch too or that's a problem, only in english. only in english i think. it's probably my job to figure that out, does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever then th we have to think about that. maybe maybe it's too hard to to realise that. we have short time to to put it on the market, in indeed the languages are a difficult thing. i don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. a someone says that give me one coke, and the t_v_ turns to one. and then you have to say t_v_ channel one, or something. not just one, okay, no speech recognition.do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? yeah, i think so. if you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, it lights up when it's dark? if you push something, it it all lights up. it it mustn't work all the time. it it have to work only when you use it. if you use one button, it must turn on for twenty seconds, and then it must turn off. it's the same as the telephone. yeah. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. teletext options are only four buttons or something. because you ne almost never use it. but younger people i think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext. i use te teletext every day, i think. and i think, 'cause we don't have that many buttons, we just keep it one level then?trendwatching. you know what you have to do.you know what you have to do. trendwatching.could i think of favourites? i always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number. but if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. so you might as well remember the number. maybe i maybe it's too complicated, i would find it handy, i think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six. but how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button? if i use my telephone, i never use those buttons to to to call if i don't do it, maybe old people they don't like new features. right.the working design. the method i used is search the web. just the web page provided. basically what happens is you press a button, then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch. and by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows what bu button is pressed. then the chip produces a pattern. like a morse code and and sends that to the l_e_d_. and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light. and transmit that to the t_v_. we we also have to have a led li led light on it? ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting? red's l shows up like something's wrong, and green is like it's okay, on most remote controls it's red. the energy source is the battery, basically. that's connecting to all the components. the subcomponent is w i i think it is the button pressed. when you press a button, a switch get closed. so the chip knows what button you pressed. and the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb. so that's the led, l_e_d_.the whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons. i i think the batteries will be a little we have a recharger in it, if we can still make that then it's just to indicate something's on. that it's working. we can make the normal one also a normal light. not a led light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. so you see green if you push that button. i think it's unnecessary power you use then. but does it make any difference for the energy you use? i it it will look different, is leds beneath the the buttons? yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even. the same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean? it it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much. maybe that's a good idea for old people as well. it's only few leds. only four or something. four led. but if we use a battery station, yeah, that's a good idea, okay.and the receptor in the t_v_ senses the pattern. so we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. so that it can be used with all the t_v_s. we have to really understand what patterns are used, otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, the chip is producing the pattern. so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to an automatically search function for each television, or something. i dunno how it's exactly how it works. i i use a universal remote control, and you have to put in a number, i have a modern one. and the modern one you you you type search, and after a short time the television turns off. and then you know, oh it it's the right one. we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. that's when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern. but ma basically for brands of t_v_ these patterns are different. what you have to do is get these patterns right. what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television. and when it's switched off, you can push a button as it's working now, and then he saves that settingand the the forty plus people, i already told you. oh, this is a problem. oh sorry about that. the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. so it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's it changes things. i just i just didn't read it well. that kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. i think the thing in the dark is a good way, to make it more like a mobile phone. more modern.but the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. spongy, like sponge. so rubber, kind of. soft materials. but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. but i didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball.it's very difficult to to to do it. because it's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control. that's the problem. that's the main problem. maybe we watch the first the next two presentations. actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. but maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, i think it would be better to implement l_c_d_ as well. since you have to configure speech thing. but a telephone also have a l_c_d_ and and it's about t two hundred euros. we have to decide on that. i got an email and it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced. they say a display requires an advanced chip. and this is more expensive than all the other chips. and speech recognition? yeah, probably too. i i haven't got anything about speech recognition,i just want to give you mike again, the first presentation i received an email and i searched on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. it has been done in italy italy and in another country in europe, but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. so it's very important for us to create something new. fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. this aspect is the most important one. it is twice important as the following. the second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative. that stands for new technical features. and then that this is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of l_c_d_ or speech recognition. but we already have the flashing flashing light the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. we already discussed that. d our our target group we thought about was young and trendy. so i took that part of the webpage. and it says fashion-watchers of pari france and italy, yeah, have detected the following trends. this trends i th trend i think it's not that meaningful for us, maybe. but it's about clothes and shoes. but the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. spongy, like sponge. so rubber, kind of. soft materials. but maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. but i didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball. because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control, i think about changeable fronts. maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. and some basic colour fronts. maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. just another shape than a normal remote control ha has. we have to discuss about that. main point stillbut they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. so it's very important for us to create something new. this aspect is the most important one.we're going to talk about the conceptual model. i just show you the m the no the the the the the the minutes, minute. we just talked about it looks. has to look nice. usability is very important. people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. it has to be very basic, not too many buttons. light switches on if you use a button. text t_v_ still has to be a possibility. and it has to be easy to learn. and the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute button, and a text t_v_ button. that are the functions.i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. that's for the next one.actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. it's very difficult to to to do it. but maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, i think it would be better to implement l_c_d_ as well. you mean these to the low? but i i think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. yeah, just th th th other buttons like text t_v_. put that on the button bottom. m maybe we cho should put that on top, i think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. maybe you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy. it doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. but i think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, but but i i think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. i think it will only look more like the old remote controls. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. do we s keep that? it it would be would be a good feature feature.like a very big scroll-wheel. but just not on the top, but on the side of it. i think you'll get a a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted. maybe you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy. i think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. it doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. i think zapping is the highest priority. but i think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, but but i i think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. so so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning time. we have to care that it r looks really new. because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control. 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. but i i it should be round in in shape. if we do it like that we have below have we a lot of room to put a nice logo. you have to look at that image of the ipod. and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? maybe you can buy separate ones buy the product. you buy, you get one. and basic. y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? you could put it like that, so top down. do we have to design that w as well? the docking station? but th yeah, that can be very simple. least. but we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. as long as it isn is in two d_ we can use all kind of round shapes. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. ifor volume. for volume, or a channel. here we have also side scrolls. the scroll wheels, that's cool. that's for the volume.we still want to have a recharger, don't we? re recharger. base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. so the energy is the recharger. just a normal battery.maybe maybe make the the the wha what's it called scroll wheel. make it in in yellow or something. just like the colours of real reaction.it it could be like a nokia, like plastic. with the hard hard buttons. so that should be hard plastic. we just make it plastic. just hard plastic? the case is just a plastic one.the component design. i looked at some similar devices, and my own common knowledge. this was on the web site. if you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. so flashy kinda colours. shapes should be curved, so round shapes. not nothing square-like. ipod is trendy. and it is well curved square. we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. and sports and gaming device style characteristics.the buttons. normal rubber i think. like normal ordinary buttons. soft. it it could be like a nokia, like plastic. with the hard hard buttons. i think rubber really has an odd look. the the the new new modern remote controls, the buttons are part of the the style, i think is part of the remote control itself. it don't come out of the on the background. it's it's all on one level. so that should be hard plastic. but maybe you can m make a round fluff or soft material. basic remote control from normal plastic, the rounds of it from softer s the normal infrared l_e_d_ i think s sufficient. and back light l_e_d_s. but i think there are multiple colour leds. and in green colour, the back lights just make it some different colours. blue, red and green, or something.but just in two d_, not in depth. more rounded. but i i it should be round in in shape. you have to look at that image of the ipod. but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. the colours also. so we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public. maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. can't we use different fron fronts, with all with the the logo on it? can we do that? so like fronts in in red and yellow and blue still still transparent. yeah. but with all with logo on it. but anyways it should be transparent. just like a mobile phone, you can make different fronts on it. just give five with them, just in a box. five different but y you could you could make 'em like blue and transparent.i don't think that's an opportunity.i had to make a sort of a design. i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls. so i did some searching on the internet. this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players. mobile phones. just modern modern but still basic. you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. and here you just have one, few buttons. i definitely think we should go like this. and then changeable fonts, it's the most important part, i think. and the home base is something like that, something simple. and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit. basic buttons. on-off, mute. and th maybe two others, i dunno. text buttons. and then the colour buttons, if we want it on. i don't find it very usable, and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the ipod. they can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. and f above ten. that's on on the display. that th there is no display there. but it's on the place of the display. and i think we should light this up much more than that part. my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. m_p_ three player. if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we i don't think we should put it on top then. i think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open. if you put in speech recognition, you need so more many more buttons.i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. that's for the next one. but you definitely get a specific instruction. but th think about something that's more rounded. yeah, five. let's give five.can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, probably we need a advanced chip then. it it would be would be a good feature feature.so you don't see all the buttons you else need. but it sounds very difficult to use. because the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. so you can't use your thumb for it. here we have also side scrolls. i dunno if we can use that. do we want to use for volume. for volume, or a channel. then we can even simplify it more. by just putting the volume on the side. and and just channel buttons here. the channel buttons are often used. and you can't use them now with your thumb, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom. yeah, just th th th other buttons like text t_v_. put that on the button bottom. you mean these to the low? except from the on-off button. but i i think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. so maybe we can put that on the bottom. i think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top. i think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. i think th the the top buttons are okay. they sh those should be on top. but we we can switch those two,but i think we have to make the case transparent, you can just make them around the buttons the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in. we still want to have a recharger, don't we? re recharger. base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. it's just batteries, it's dark in the room. but you mostly use it indoors, or we can also use solar cells. for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic like with the pulse watch. cases, flat, so uncurved. two d_ curved is like front to the back. and three d_ curved is also in depth. but with three d_ curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. so we can't use the flat buttons. these kinda materials can be used. we just make it plastic. and the l_c_d_. we need the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an l_c_d_. i don't think that's an opportunity. are are we using a a rubber case, i don't think a rubber case looks the trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh fresh. fruit and veg can be just the covers. i can't imagine a soft remote control. titanium, i think it's too expensive. just hard plastic? not the sh the square form. you can make it curved or round. but just in two d_, not in depth. more rounded. so the energy is the recharger. we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. what exactly. just a normal battery. the case is just a plastic one. yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one. and we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel.and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? yeah, five. let's give five.yeah, we just made a word file with the basic elements. simply a square with round corners. the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent. the functions are just basic. mute function, on-off function, text functions. and the logo is over here, and the mic. so how many functions do you need for for the microphone? yeah, speech recognition. i didn't have a specification of that. but i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. only one button to say it's on or off. yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. so on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know. it's twelve buttons. f the form well, we've taken that from the ipod, other popular technical device. we'll use hard plastic. since that allows us to use two d_ buttons, non-rubber buttons. we have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. and also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.are we doing the the speech recognition? okay, but it's still possible financially. okay yeah. well then then we're gonna put it in. or are we making a slide open, like underneath? slide open is quite usable for remote controls. it's may maybe a bit stronger as well. yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. no, you have a different chip for speech recognition. so so i already calculated that and it's still in the budget.so these are the last notes we i made. f you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. if anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then.okay, maybe we use this button for the okay, there is one function i use daily, and it's not on the basic functions. it's to switch to your scart. just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. right, the video channel, play station, etcetera. that's used pretty often. so here are multiple speech buttons, i don't know how many. menu buttons with arrows. maybe one button to switch the colour of your leds? colour buttons. yeah, maybe some some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. there's one text button i prefer. that's the one that you use if you search for a page, like seven hundred, and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. if you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? that's a functionality for the television. the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. th th th if you switch it on.we have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. and also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know. it's twelve buttons.digital pen is horrible. but if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, i think. just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. but you might as well do it in normal computer style.colour changeable, and also transparent.i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. i think that was the m biggest problem.it's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. like the prices. if we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker.well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. and h how does the second level come out? it slides along?okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. so i think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three euros. but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or can we make that for h twenty cents? the b the button supplements, i didn't i d i was wondering if this special colour maybe was but this is expensive, the sample speaker. is that included? in the twelve euro orso how many functions do you need for for the microphone? yeah, speech recognition. i didn't have a specification of that. but i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. only one button to say it's on or off. yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. so so here are multiple speech buttons, i don't know how many.yeah, i made some criteria, so we can ev evaluate our model. and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. we sh we we we can give it a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our and we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. if it's really, if you can if you can get the ipod look, then it's beautiful, i think. the basic colours are black or green or yellow? maybe company colours? a bit a bit of yellow. yeah, grey. just dark grey i think. changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. okay, just give it a two. the fancy look-and-feel. and we can change the colours, so that's really fancy i think. it's pretty cool. if you slide it open, it lights up. and th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. i think it's one. learnable? easy to use? it's it's very easy to use, but the second layer is not easy to use. and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. because because i think i think the scroll wheel, it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. then a two. new features. techno technological innovative? and the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. the speech function is new. and the slide. i think the slide is pretty new. but then we also have the the home station. we are forgetting about that now, but yeah, we didn't draw that too, but okay. and new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? no, just so it's still a two. yeah, but did we reach, with our style, the targeted audience? you get the fancy things for younger people. and you get the the aesthetic things for older people. but we didn't follow the latest trends. yeah, you could make a a front like a a f banana kind of front. so we giveit's twelve buttons. it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as i know.i think just i just write a final report. fill in the questionnaire.the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent.so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for for everything together. was there room for creativity? i yeah, i think so. yeah m if we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity i think we discussed a lot of things about it. so okay, so the leadership just normal discussion, i think. not one leader or something. team work the third meeting i think that one was pretty hard. we were not all we were not agree with every not agree with. i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. i think that was the m biggest problem. like the prices. if we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker. but the teamwork was okay. yeah, everybody could speak their opinion. i think everyone listen to each other. the smart board is okay. digital pen is horrible. but if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, i think. just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. but you might as well do it in normal computer style. new ideas found. i don't know what it mean. to gather, or to work together, or new ideas for yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. because we don't have any sizes and yeah, but it you can't possibly do that in such a short time, i think. yeah, this this is just the idea phase,and the marketing expert should come up with user requirements. therefore we have to to do some internet search. for example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions?this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design. the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera.and it seems you get more information by email.we can sell them at twenty five euros.the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million euros.and the production cost should be the half of the selling price.i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video. and reserve the possibility to add other features.we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. we should take some practice. i have some instructions now to do that. you know how to the documents work. this for toolbar. you see it next. and we can use this pen to perform. it doesn't always work. and in the format menu you can select colour and line width, etcetera etcetera. each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal. you should explain with different colours and with different pen widths. and you should explain why you draw that particular animal. different pen widths, how do you do that? with the format menu. and use different colours etcetera. it's a giraffe. yeah. can you use one blank sheet per drawing? or so y you must save it at the end you can press the next button, i in the file option menu. is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? introduction and get acquainted i'm guessing a turtle. how to select the next or colours were under format a fox yeah. it's a cat.let's get started. opening acquaintance, tool training, how to use the things here. project plan discussion, and yeah then the rest of the meeting. we're supposed to develop a new remote control, that's both original, trendy and user-friendly. we're work we're working from top to bottom. functional design, then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera etcetera. and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up.and i'll see you again when the computer tells us to. let's see what we got to do.i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there, which i know, there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. you need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. and you you don't need that for a t_v_. and and for a t teletext you need additional buttons as well, so i kind of need to know what we need. and then we can discuss it with the next meeting. we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video. and reserve the possibility to add other features. so we have a basic starting point so make sure it's extendible. yeah. and you can always extend that it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. th the least amount of functions possiblethe user interface designer should specify the technical functions.we each have a specific task, i didn't know if you received the same mail. as i saw in my mail. this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design. the user interface designer should specify the technical functions. and the marketing expert should come up with user requirements. did any of you already do some work on this part i started making an overview for myself, what i had to do, and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever. 'cause we have three design steps and what did the marketing expert do? from a marketing perspective, well the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements. what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? there are a few means to reach that by by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market. i mean, what functions do they have. especially what are their shortcomings? are there any new functions which can be added to our product? therefore we have to to do some internet search. for example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions? and we can interview current users and future users. what w what would they like to see on a new remote control? especially for future users, i'm thinking of early adopters, because they they use new technology first, but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are? no n not specifically.we have a financial aspect to this project. we can sell them at twenty five euros. the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million euros. that's quite a big amount of money. and the production cost should be the half of the selling price. now it's time for some discussion. i'm taking notes.the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera. i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session? do we only have to to do phase one, the functional design? after that we are going to the conceptual we have meeting, individual work, meeting. and at the end of the day we have a final meeting. i mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? i think that is the user requirements part. as to what they want. do they want all those functions on that small but but we need good communication about this stuff, so if i don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard.and do you have any ideas about the product so far? i started i started with the first phase, i had to focus on the working design, which you said. i basically had two points. according to the coffee machine example, i have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_. i got another point. it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo. it's some buttons for for the on off function. and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. that are the the basic options for a remote control. i mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. i got some requirements it has it has to be user-friendly. really easy to use buttons, not not very small buttons, but not the the also the big big buttons, it has to be a small unit. you can take it with you everywhere in in your house. and a and a good zapping range. the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance. i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment. i think we can go ahead with what we have. i will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want yeah so what we might wanna do is yeah cust i have customised the screen functions, if you know what i mean. the the simple functions for for the the whole public, and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with you can make a if you make a drawing. basic. so it should fit right in into your hand. okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, and the screen is below, and the buttons are in the middle. but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top, and for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone. yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. so we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo i mean this is basically numbers, volume, channel up and down. yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and and image options right? so channel programming? yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour. s swap channels? swap's good option. that's very good idea. hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons? so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry, is if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice. so maybe make one one okay button and and one navigation button. yeah okay. so on the on the top is better. depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but i think that's okay.but it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. and the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.i w i should put the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display. under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, according to the old principle. and the l_c_d_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared decoder yeah. yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour.i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need. this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well i was working on this before i got my information. so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. and well the info on the website which came too late. but yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow, so i was trying to organise them for myself.the user interface designer can design a menu for all these function and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on thehey what's wrong with my computer? i think you have to change your desktop yeah my computer is not functioning properly. did you plug in the power cable when you come back? you pressed alt f_ four? no no no. i pressed the mouse button.i'm gonna talk about functional requirements. well some research has be done has been done. observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. and they also filled in a questionnaire. they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. users think they're ugly. they are often lost somewhere in the room. it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. and they're bad for r_s_i_. they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users.and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes.most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass. most relevant, most used functions, power button, channel, volume selection. teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future.and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech menu button access the menu in the l_c_d_ screen.well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups, nice design, which does not make the remote control in your room.all the functional aspects of the remote i think are in my department.okay. so he's layout and you're function. isn't that more the the u the user interface part? i think that's a that's a good separation. yeah we have to kind of work together.by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from? i receiv the mail but you don't. so no so it's a text file n in the project folder. and the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. but it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.and the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. it should be designed for a use g group below forty, the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen. sixteen to forty.i had two examples. this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. this the easy one i think we have to to combine them. and yeah merge the best functions of all examples. okay so so we have the option for more functions. yeah but i prefer we we use the the basic options yeah. we have to to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button. yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed. so maybe you can hide them or something. so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, with a clear menu. so we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionableyeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. screen settings, brightness and colour. menu button access the menu in the l_c_d_ screen. and then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate.and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech so what does the screen do? for for the advanced functions i think. well i, my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced advanced functions.yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for t_v_.but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for t_v_.well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well i was working on this before i got my information. so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. and well the info on the website which came too late. but yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow, so i was trying to organise them for myself. i mean everything speaks for itself i guess. mean you press a button the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies. and the t_v_ will translate it into a function.i thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display and four cursors. most of the time you have one button in the middle. it says menu, and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level.hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons? so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. that's very good idea.so we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo yeah okay. so on the on the top is better.so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.you will do the evaluation. you probably get a mail. yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow.but basically you two are going to work on the smartboard. next thirty minutes to design something so so we're gonna work here? on this sketchboard?most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. instead of the current functional look-and-feel. and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, and the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. i first chose for the battery, 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious, easiest choice to go to. but i really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy,advanced chip. okay.so welcome to the marketing presentation once again. fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public, because that's our public. fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing, shoes and furniture. and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey. oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. instead of the current functional look-and-feel. and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, and the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing, and and some fruit and colours just made a quick design.the case would be doubly curved. so rubber material.i didn't get any information about that so i'm just thinking, this is not my department, but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost, advanced chip. okay. rubber material. the case would be doubly curved. so so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. do you have a picture of doubly curved case? this is the the menu i was looking at. s see this is the the the standard traditional type, where the form yeah serves the function, you know. but this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that. and th that means curved in both dire dire dimensions. where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold. and th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. so yeah but that's that's the the problem yeah the dilemma actually, 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, and with a lot of shape. yeah, and the and the rubber, it it will look cheap always, okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the the buttons. if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it. and this is, this is with the curved that i mean. well we could make a compromise between that. instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. so to appeal a little more to the all the public. yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? i would go for the double curved. i mean our aim is to make something different right? and i i'm i'm thinking you know a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb. but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. you can make a trigger button or something like that. and we need something that well that that you can ableone one very important thing i was yeah thinking about is the speech option. i think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present. but do j do we do the speech just for the basic options, for the simple buttons? for for everything, in the in the last meeting we we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated. pressing the the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control. and only the the l_c_d_ panel will light up and then you can only change the yeah the options. but this is the the the simple layout. display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button. and if there are older people they wanted more yeah more luxurous so that's an a also an option.so we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. the case would be doubly curved. so rubber material.i'm dealing with the components design. i used some design examples we had from similar products. for example the energy source. we have four types. the basic battery. we have a hand dynamo, the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it. and of course solar cells. for the a case, there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case. single curved, which means that it has curves in one dimension. or the double curved. but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now. well we have all kinds of hard materials like the the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium. i would definitely go for rubber we have yeah several interface designs. we can use a scroll buttons for the menus, but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons, for the the arrow buttons. the advanced chip i think is easiest to implement for the production, 'cause they they can print it better. i can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make. but it is more longlasting, that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again. and especially when the material's rubber. it can be done, i mean, you can't harm it, no it means curved in two dimensions. so double curved is like this, this, this, or so w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the the buttons. if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it. how about we do a a pop-up screen, like the laptop. if you can flip. but i dunno if that's too expensive. okay so the buttons are on top here, and you flip it over that way. and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically. so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. well yeah the the idea of it was, is that because you close it, you cover the l_c_d_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever. we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break. i don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? like some soft green or something? orange or something. and then and then very bright, a yellow banana, an orange, a green apple, stuff like that, yeah w we need very primary colours, like bright red, bright yellow. yeah but the primary colours w we can create with the with the leds on the on the remote control. if you make it just a yeah bl give it a blue colour, then it's just a neutral colour, so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess. yeah with some some yellow banana i mean, the the colour of the background of the display? so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. maybe a maybe a white a white backlight? but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours? so th the total of the thing is very bright? but then then again, which colour should the buttons be? but maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people. red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate. even for colourblindinstead of doubly curved we take a single curved. so to appeal a little more to the all the public. well we could make a compromise between that. yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? i would go for the double curved. i mean our aim is to make something different right? but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. so then you have double double curved in some way.i'm just thinking, this is not my department, but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost, i didn't get any information about that soso double curved is like this, this, this, or no it means curved in two dimensions. so w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.. i did get a bit more done than the last time, 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the sometimes i have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there, and also with i don't know how to use powerpoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it.oh yeah, we have to do the project evaluation. so how were did the project process go? did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? yeah well at first i was really stressed. because it went a bit fast. but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on, the second time i think i did a bit better. because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. and then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. so the process, i mean, the interaction between us became better and better i guess. yeah. especially after the first meeting. well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of the the board and powerpoint and word and stuff like that. so and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the smartboard. because it it it just works better. but the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. and as i said, i have no idea how powerpoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation. okay, are are there any new ideas about this? it's use especially useful, i guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. i think the powerpoint is is too limited. yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. yeah. but it it's useful tothe process, i mean, the interaction between us became better and better i guess. yeah. especially after the first meeting.makes three point one one one one one one one. so we're better than average.yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this okay we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? yeah we we can just use this one. and then over-paint it with the green the the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. oh and you might want to add a infrared led. well i have to make an report of every decision we made so far. and i try to get chip just before i receive the excel sheet. but maybe you can help me. okay, but how do we make the the scroll button? the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance. it's not very fashionable anymore. but it's okay. maybe that's a s a special colour for it. so we can make it special? can we do a print? i'm not sure. shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? we have the original balance sheet, or okay, it's not the prettiest, i know. maybe maybe it c it can say that. the real remote. shall we do the logo in black or not? well it's it's single single curved. but it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice.that was exactly my point. like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway. so we'll just have to use it for everything. integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. if you lose the the back, the okay button v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the menu button. with with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing. yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. so okay. make it a special colour and then it look fancy.i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? i don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. yeah, but there are no negative questions i guess. so it were all positive questions, by by purpose. so yeah true. yes, so the it tells us something, yes.was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means ofit's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing.we all have to keep in mind what has changed now. so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements. well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale, as following. well the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. and we all have to agree on a certain level. well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. i think it does. because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l_c_d_, okay well i say still two, but it has to be three then. the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. yeah. well, yeah. so it it's a very true point. i mean it hides all those function. it shows the relevant and most used functions. it automatically has the the programme and the volume function, okay five. the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition. yeah, i say two. okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. so we still we still have the primary colours. but only on the on the outside, not on the button. yeah still we we dropped also on the the double curve. it should have been two questions. i realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped.. so maybe in the middle or something. actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. i mean the sponge-like and the three d_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. the remote control displays the corporate logo. but there's enough space for the corporate logo. i mean, if there's only one thing. and even the shape we have now simulates kind of an r_ and the reversed r_, the remote control is easy to use. skill, i would say six, or something. i don't think it's easy to use, or notdo we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. but we don't have any basic options any more. they don't need special colours. so let's go for the plastic. so the only option is an hand dynamo. drop the the special colour, and do the special colour for the buttons. yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour.yeah, i have still ten minutes to finish the report.i mean we're gonna use the l_c_d_ screen anyway. so we'll just have to use it for everything. could drop the speech recognition. there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen. yeah. let's drop the speech.the the board and powerpoint and word and stuff like that. so and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the smartboard. because it it it just works better. but the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. and as i said, i have no idea how powerpoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation. i think the powerpoint is is too limited. yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. yeah. but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then tookay. first of all i'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. because we have a problem. it has to be twelve and a half. you're going to redesign something. okay, so we're at twenty five.because we have a problem. it has to be twelve and a half. you're going to redesign something. okay, so we're at twenty five.so the only option is an hand dynamo. let's let's go for the hand dynamo then.i mean we have to drop on everything. another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. but we don't have any basic options any more. but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. could drop the speech recognition. there are more people who like speech recognition than an l_c_d_ screen.yeah. let's drop the speech.integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. with with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing.so let's go for the plastic.\""
